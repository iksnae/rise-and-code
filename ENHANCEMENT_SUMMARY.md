### Tone Enhancements Applied

✅ **Warmth & Character**
- Introduced character guides (Recipe, Data, Patterns) who act as friendly mentors
- Conversational, encouraging tone throughout
- Emoji signage for visual interest and quick scanning

✅ **Story-Driven, Not Academic**
- Replaced technical definitions with relatable scenarios
- Each concept grounded in everyday experience
- "Real-world connection" threads maintained but condensed

✅ **Playful Engagement**
- Shorter paragraphs for readability
- Activity-oriented structure (every section has hands-on exercise)
- Questions posed to engage curiosity, not lecture

✅ **Inclusive Language**
- Removed jargon; use simple, direct language
- All-ages accessible (no computer access required)
- Diverse scenarios reflect global perspectives

✅ **Activity Sheet Model**
- All hands-on exercises reference printable activity sheets (3A-5H)
- Maintains separation: content + printable workbook
- Clear callouts: **See Activity Sheet XY!**
