# About Rise & Code

Rise & Code is a free, open-source programming book designed for people without access to computers. The book teaches fundamental programming concepts, computational thinking, and problem-solving skills using just paper and pencil.

## Our Mission

We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn programming and computational thinking, regardless of their access to technology. Rise & Code aims to bridge the digital divide by providing high-quality educational content that can be used with minimal resources.

## Who This Book Is For

- Students in resource-constrained environments
- Educators teaching in areas with limited technology
- Anyone interested in learning programming fundamentals
- Communities looking to build technological literacy
- Self-learners without regular computer access

## How It Works

The book uses innovative paper-based exercises, the "notebook method," and clear, jargon-free explanations to make programming concepts accessible to everyone. All activities can be completed with just a notebook and pencil.
