your own context?</li>
<li>What was the most challenging concept related to loops? How did you
overcome this challenge?</li>
<li>How do loops connect to the other programming concepts we’ve learned
so far (variables, data types, conditional statements)?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="looking-ahead-3">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In Chapter 6, “The Engineering Notebook: Practicing Like a Pro,”
we’ll explore how professional programmers document their work. We’ll
build on the loop concepts and other programming fundamentals we’ve
learned to develop a structured approach to solving problems.</p>
