# Activity: Identifying Computational Thinking in Everyday Life

## Overview
This activity helps you recognize how computational thinking is already present in your daily life and community. By identifying these patterns, you'll develop an eye for the logical processes that underlie both everyday tasks and computer programming.

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize the four elements of computational thinking in real-world situations
- Practice identifying patterns and algorithms in familiar contexts
- Connect abstract programming concepts to concrete experiences
- Build awareness of computational thinking as a universal skill

## Materials Needed
- Notebook and pencil
- Optional: colored pencils or markers for categorization

## Time Required
45-60 minutes

## Background: The Four Elements of Computational Thinking

Before starting the activity, let's understand the four key elements of computational thinking:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying similarities or patterns in problems
3. **Abstraction**: Focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant details
4. **Algorithms**: Developing step-by-step solutions or rules to follow

These elements form the foundation of how programmers solve problems, but they're also used in many everyday situations.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Observing Computational Thinking
1. In your notebook, create a table with four columns labeled: "Activity/Process," "Decomposition," "Pattern Recognition," and "Abstraction/Algorithms."
2. Observe your surroundings and daily activities for about 30 minutes. You can do this at home, in your community, or by thinking about familiar processes.
3. Look for at least 5 activities or processes that involve some form of systematic thinking or problem-solving.
4. For each activity, note in your table:
   - What is the activity/process?
   - How is it broken down into smaller steps? (Decomposition)
   - What patterns or similarities exist within the process? (Pattern Recognition)
   - What rules or steps are followed to complete it? (Abstraction/Algorithms)

### Part 2: Analyzing Your Examples
After identifying your examples, answer these questions for each one:
1. Which elements of computational thinking are strongest in this example?
2. Could this process be automated or done by a computer? Why or why not?
3. How might understanding this as computational thinking help improve the process?

### Part 3: Creating a Visual Map
1. Choose your favorite example from your observations.
2. Create a visual representation of the computational thinking involved:
   - Draw a flowchart showing the steps (algorithm)
   - Use different colors to highlight patterns
   - Circle the smaller sub-problems (decomposition)
   - Put a box around the most essential elements (abstraction)

### Part 4: Reflection
In your notebook, reflect on the following questions:
1. Were you surprised by how much computational thinking exists in everyday activities?
2. Which of the four elements did you find easiest to identify? Which was most challenging?
3. How might you apply computational thinking more deliberately to solve problems in your life?
4. How do you think computational thinking relates to computer programming?

## Example

Here's an example of how to analyze cooking a traditional meal:

**Activity/Process**: Cooking rice and beans

**Decomposition**:
- Preparing the beans (soaking, seasoning)
- Cooking the rice separately
- Preparing additional ingredients (chopping onions, garlic)
- Combining components at the right time

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Similar preparation methods for different ingredients (washing, cutting)
- Repeated tasting and adjusting of seasoning
- Similar cooking process to other grain/legume dishes

**Abstraction/Algorithms**:
- Rules for determining when beans are fully cooked
- Specific order of adding ingredients
- Timing rules (rice needs X minutes, beans need Y minutes)
- Temperature adjustments at different stages

**Could this be automated?** Parts of it could be automated (like using a rice cooker or pressure cooker), but human judgment for seasoning and final quality would be harder to automate.

## Extension Activities
- Compare computational thinking across different cultures' approaches to similar tasks
- Interview someone in a technical or non-technical profession about how they use systematic thinking
- Redesign a common process in your community using computational thinking principles to make it more efficient
- Create a "computational thinking challenge" for a friend or family member

## Connection to Programming
The same thinking patterns you've identified in everyday activities form the foundation of computer programming. Programmers decompose problems, look for patterns, abstract essential information, and create algorithmsâ€”just as you've observed in familiar processes. As you continue through this book, you'll learn how to express these thinking patterns in ways that could eventually be translated into code.
