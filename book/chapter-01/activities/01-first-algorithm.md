# Activity: Your First Algorithm

## Overview
This activity introduces you to creating algorithms—step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. You'll practice breaking down a familiar task into clear, precise steps that could be followed by someone who has never done the task before.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what an algorithm is
- Practice writing clear, precise instructions
- Learn to break complex tasks into simple steps
- Identify assumptions in instructions

## Materials Needed
- Notebook and pencil
- Optional: colored pencils or markers

## Time Required
30-45 minutes

## Instructions

### Part 1: Choose Your Task
1. Select a simple, everyday task that you know how to do. Some ideas:
   - Making a sandwich
   - Brushing teeth
   - Tying shoelaces
   - Drawing a simple shape
   - Planting a seed

2. In your notebook, write the name of your task at the top of the page.

### Part 2: Write Your Algorithm
1. Think about how to complete your task, breaking it down into individual steps.
2. Write down each step in order, starting with step 1.
3. Be as clear and specific as possible. Imagine you're writing instructions for someone who has never done this task before.
4. Aim for at least 10 steps.

### Part 3: Test Your Algorithm
1. Review your algorithm and look for any missing steps or assumptions.
2. If possible, ask a friend or family member to follow your instructions exactly as written. Watch them without providing any additional guidance.
3. Note any points where they get confused or where your instructions weren't clear enough.

### Part 4: Debug and Improve
1. Based on your observations, revise your algorithm to fix any problems.
2. Add steps where needed and clarify ambiguous instructions.
3. Write your improved algorithm on a new page in your notebook.

### Part 5: Reflect
Answer these questions in your notebook:
1. What was the most challenging part of writing your algorithm?
2. Did you make any assumptions in your original instructions? What were they?
3. How is writing an algorithm similar to or different from giving directions to a person?
4. Why do you think computers need more precise instructions than humans?

## Example
Here's an example of an algorithm for making a cup of tea:

1. Get a clean cup
2. Get a tea bag
3. Fill a kettle with water
4. Place the kettle on the stove
5. Turn on the stove to high heat
6. Wait until the water boils
7. Turn off the stove
8. Pour the hot water into the cup, filling it about 2 cm from the top
9. Place the tea bag in the cup
10. Wait 3 minutes for the tea to steep
11. Remove the tea bag from the cup
12. (Optional) Add sugar or milk according to taste
13. Stir the tea

## Extension Activities
- Try to rewrite your algorithm with the minimum possible steps while keeping it clear
- Write an algorithm for a different audience (e.g., a child, an adult, a robot)
- Draw symbols or diagrams to represent each step in your algorithm
- Find a published recipe and analyze it as an algorithm. Could you improve it?

## Connection to Programming
In programming, algorithms are at the heart of every program. Programmers need to break down problems into clear, logical steps that a computer can follow. The skills you practiced in this activity—clarity, precision, and attention to detail—are exactly what you need to write effective computer programs.
