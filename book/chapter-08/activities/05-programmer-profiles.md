#### Profile 1: Nji Collins Gbah (Cameroon)

Nji Collins grew up in Bamenda, Cameroon, where consistent electricity and internet access were major challenges. Despite these limitations, he became fascinated with technology after seeing a computer for the first time when he was 12 years old.

Without regular computer access, Nji initially learned programming concepts using books and occasional visits to a local cyber café. He kept detailed notebooks where he would write out code by hand, solving programming problems on paper before testing them when he could get computer time.

His breakthrough came when he saved enough money to buy a second-hand smartphone. With this modest device, he downloaded programming tutorials and documentation when he had internet access, then studied them offline. He began solving competitive programming challenges using just his phone, sometimes staying up late to access cheaper nighttime data rates.

When Google held its Code-in contest, Nji persisted through internet blackouts in his region (sometimes traveling to areas with connectivity) to submit his solutions. In 2017, he became the first African winner of the global competition, solving problems related to information security.

Since then, Nji has worked on projects to improve internet security and to create educational resources for other young Africans interested in technology. He emphasizes the importance of community—both finding supportive peers locally and connecting with the broader programming community online when possible.

His advice to aspiring programmers with limited resources: "Start with what you have, where you are. The concepts are what matter, not the devices. Write code on paper, solve problems in your head, and use whatever technology you can access—even if it's just occasionally—to test and refine your ideas."

#### Profile 2: Seema Puthyapurayil (India)

Seema grew up in a rural village in Kerala, India, where her family had no computer and limited educational resources. Her first exposure to programming concepts came through a unique outreach program where volunteers taught basic computational thinking using paper-based activities.

Intrigued by these concepts, Seema began creating her own system to track and optimize her family's small farm operations. Using notebooks and hand-drawn charts, she developed algorithms to determine optimal planting schedules based on weather patterns, crop rotation needs, and market prices. Her system helped increase her family's crop yield by nearly 30% in the first year.

A local agricultural extension officer noticed her systematic approach and connected her with a regional technical institute where she could use computers occasionally. Seema would prepare her programs on paper, then use her limited computer time efficiently to test and refine them.

She eventually received a scholarship to study computer science, where professors were impressed by her deep understanding of programming logic despite her limited prior access to technology. Her experience with manual computational systems gave her unique insights into algorithm optimization.

Today, Seema develops agricultural technology solutions for rural farmers, creating systems that work with minimal technological infrastructure. Her applications are designed to function on basic mobile phones and with intermittent connectivity, reflecting her understanding of rural constraints.

"The lack of technology in my early years was actually an advantage," she says. "It forced me to understand the underlying logic deeply rather than relying on trial-and-error coding. I learned to think through algorithms completely before implementing them, which is a skill many programmers never develop."

#### Profile 3: Luis Hernandez (Colombia)

Luis grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Medellín, Colombia, where violence and economic hardship were daily realities. His school had one shared computer lab with outdated machines that students could use for just 30 minutes per week.

Fascinated by how programs worked, Luis began reverse-engineering simple applications during his limited computer time. He would take detailed notes about program behaviors, then spend the week between sessions developing hypotheses about how the code might be structured.

With encouragement from a teacher, Luis started a notebook where he designed his own programs using pseudocode and flowcharts. He created paper prototypes of applications that could address community challenges, like a system to coordinate neighborhood safety watches or optimize the community water distribution schedule during shortages.

Luis's breakthrough came when a local tech company sponsored a programming workshop at his school. Though the workshop lasted only two days, his well-developed computational thinking skills allowed him to absorb the material quickly. His paper prototypes impressed the instructors, who offered him an internship despite his limited hands-on experience.

During the internship, Luis quickly translated his paper designs into working applications. Within two years, he was leading a team developing community-focused applications. One of his projects—a system for coordinating emergency response in underserved neighborhoods—has been implemented in several cities across Latin America.

Luis now mentors young people from similar backgrounds. "Start with the problems around you," he advises. "Before you worry about languages or tools, learn to see the world algorithmically. The technology will change, but the thinking skills are what matter most."

#### Profile 4: Amara Okoye (Nigeria)

Amara grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, with limited exposure to computers. Her first introduction to programming came through an unusual source: a board game about coding concepts that a community organization brought to her school.

Fascinated by the logical puzzles in the game, Amara began creating her own versions with paper and cardboard, designing challenges that required players to think algorithmically. She used these games to teach basic programming concepts to younger students, developing a deeper understanding through teaching.

When her family got a basic mobile phone with internet capabilities, Amara used it to research programming concepts during free wifi access at a local community center. She filled notebooks with code examples and explanations, creating her own programming textbook that she studied during power outages, which were frequent in her neighborhood.

A breakthrough came when Amara discovered a programming course that offered SMS-based lessons and assignments. Using just her family's mobile phone, she completed the course over several months, writing code on paper and sending in solutions via text message, receiving feedback the same way.

With these skills, Amara developed a paper-based system for local market vendors to track inventory and sales, which she later converted into a simple mobile application when she gained more consistent technology access. The system has helped dozens of small businesses improve their operations.

Today, Amara works as a developer and educator, creating technology education programs specifically designed for low-resource environments. "The path to programming doesn't have to start with computers," she says. "It starts with a way of thinking that you can develop anywhere, with anything."

#### Profile 5: Miguel Sanchez (Rural Mexico)

Miguel grew up in a small farming community in rural Mexico where the nearest computer was a two-hour bus ride away at a regional school. His introduction to systematic thinking came through helping his grandfather manage irrigation for their crops.

When a traveling educational program visited his village and introduced basic programming concepts through unplugged activities, Miguel recognized similarities to the systematic thinking he already used for irrigation scheduling. He began applying computational concepts to other farm challenges, creating algorithm-like procedures for various farm tasks.

Miguel kept detailed notebooks where he developed systems for optimizing seed use, predicting yields based on multiple factors, and planning harvests. He created visual "programs" using symbols and arrows that even neighbors who couldn't read could follow.

His systematic approach attracted attention when agricultural extension officers visited the region. When they saw his notebooks filled with decision trees and flowcharts, they connected him with a scholarship program for rural youth interested in technology.

The scholarship provided periodic access to a computer center in a nearby town, where Miguel quickly translated his paper systems into digital programs. Despite having less hands-on computer experience than other students, his well-developed computational thinking gave him a strong foundation.

Today, Miguel develops agricultural technology that bridges traditional farming knowledge with modern computing. His applications are designed to work in low-connectivity environments, often incorporating paper components alongside digital tools.

"In programming, the hard part isn't learning syntax—it's learning to think systematically," Miguel says. "Growing up solving real-world problems with limited resources taught me that skill better than any computer could have."

### Part 2: Comparative Analysis

Now that you've read all five profiles, let's compare and analyze them:

1. In your notebook, create a section for "Common Success Factors"

2. Create a table with these columns:
   - Factor/Strategy
   - Examples from Profiles
   - Potential Application to My Journey

3. Identify at least five factors that contributed to success across multiple profiles, such as:
   - Making the most of limited resources
   - Creating paper-based practice systems
   - Connecting programming to real community needs
   - Finding mentors or supportive communities
   - Developing strong mental models before using computers
   - Others you observe

4. For each factor, note specific examples from different profiles

5. In the third column, brainstorm how you might apply this factor in your own context

### Part 3: Journey Mapping

Let's use the insights from these profiles to think about potential programming journeys:

1. Create a timeline showing different pathways to programming success, based on the profiles you've read.

2. On your timeline, mark:
   - Starting points (where the programmers began)
   - Key resources they leveraged
   - Major milestones and turning points
   - Ultimate impacts they created

3. Add notes about how different programmers navigated similar challenges in different ways.

4. Consider creating a visual "map" that shows multiple possible routes rather than a single linear path.

### Part 4: Resource Identification

The profiles demonstrate that aspiring programmers can leverage various resources, even in constrained environments:

1. Create a "Resource Inventory" in your notebook with these categories:
   - Available Resources (what you currently have access to)
   - Potential Resources (what you might access with some effort)
   - Dream Resources (what would be ideal but isn't currently accessible)

2. Under each category, consider:
   - Physical tools (books, devices, spaces)
   - Knowledge sources (people, institutions, materials)
   - Community connections (groups, mentors, peers)
   - Time (when you could practice and learn)
   - Unique advantages (personal strengths, local opportunities)

3. Based on the profiles, add notes about creative ways to maximize available resources and potentially access new ones.

### Part 5: Personal Reflection

Now, reflect on your own potential journey:

1. Write a reflective response addressing:
   - Which programmer's story resonated with you most? Why?
   - What challenges in your context are similar to those in the profiles?
   - What unique advantages or opportunities exist in your context?
   - What strategies from these profiles might you adapt for your own journey?
   - What impact would you ultimately like to create through programming?

2. Create a short (1-2 paragraph) vision statement describing where you'd like to be in your programming journey in 3-5 years.

### Part 6: Your Programming Profile (Creative Exercise)

Imagine it's 5 years in the future, and someone is writing a profile about your programming journey:

1. Create a "Future Profile" of yourself that includes:
   - Your starting point (where you are now)
   - Challenges you overcame
   - Strategies you used to learn and grow
   - Key turning points in your journey
   - Impact you ultimately created

2. Write this in the third person, as if it were being written about you by someone else.

3. Make it realistic but ambitious—something that would inspire others as these profiles have inspired you.
