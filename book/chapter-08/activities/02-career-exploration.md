### Part 3: Role-Playing Scenarios

Now that you have your role cards, it's time to step into these professional roles and solve problems using computational thinking:

1. If working in a group, assign different roles to different participants. If working alone, you'll take on each role yourself.

2. For each of the following scenarios, the designated professional(s) should:
   - Read the scenario carefully
   - Analyze the problem using computational thinking
   - Develop a solution approach
   - Document their solution
   - Explain how programming concepts inform their approach

#### Scenario 1: Disease Outbreak Response (Healthcare Data Coordinator)
Your district has experienced unusual fever cases in three villages. You have limited testing kits, medicine, and healthcare workers. You need to design a system to:
- Identify which villages need immediate intervention
- Create a testing priority algorithm
- Develop a resource allocation plan
- Design a data tracking system to monitor the situation's evolution

#### Scenario 2: Drought Management Plan (Agricultural Systems Designer)
Your region is experiencing a drought expected to last at least six months. Water for irrigation will be limited to 60% of normal levels. You need to:
- Create a crop selection and planting schedule
- Design an optimal irrigation system
- Develop a risk management plan
- Create a monitoring system to track effectiveness

#### Scenario 3: Mixed-Level Education Program (Educational Curriculum Developer)
You need to create an educational program for a classroom with students at three different skill levels. With limited teaching resources, you must:
- Design a learning sequence that works for all levels
- Create a system to track individual progress
- Develop adaptive activities that challenge each student appropriately
- Design an assessment approach that works across levels

#### Scenario 4: Emergency Supply Distribution (Logistics Coordinator)
After a major storm, you need to distribute emergency supplies to 12 locations with different needs and accessibility challenges. You have 3 vehicles and limited fuel. You must:
- Prioritize locations based on need and accessibility
- Create optimal delivery routes
- Develop a loading plan for the vehicles
- Design a tracking system to ensure all locations receive appropriate supplies

#### Scenario 5: Community Well Construction (Community Project Manager)
Your community needs five wells in different locations. You have limited funds, volunteers with varying skills, and equipment that must be shared. You need to:
- Create a construction sequence and schedule
- Develop a volunteer assignment system
- Design a resource sharing plan
- Create a progress tracking system

#### Scenario 6: River Health Monitoring (Environmental Monitoring Technician)
You need to monitor the health of a river system with limited testing equipment. Multiple communities and farms depend on this water. You must:
- Design a testing location strategy
- Create a schedule for different types of tests
- Develop an early warning system for potential problems
- Design a data visualization approach for community members

### Part 4: Solution Presentation

After developing solutions for your assigned scenario(s):

1. Document your solution in your notebook with:
   - Problem breakdown (how you decomposed the challenge)
   - Solution approach and rationale
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - System for monitoring and adjusting the solution
   - Visual representation (flowchart, diagram, or table)

2. If working in a group, take turns presenting solutions. For each presentation:
   - Explain your role's perspective and priorities
   - Walk through your solution approach
   - Highlight the programming concepts that informed your solution
   - Explain how you addressed the main challenges

3. If working alone, imagine explaining your solution to someone unfamiliar with the role. Write a clear explanation that would help them understand your approach.

### Part 5: Career Reflection

After exploring these different professional roles, reflect on your experience:

1. In your notebook, create a personal reflection addressing:
   - Which role(s) did you find most interesting? Why?
   - Which programming concepts seemed most valuable across different roles?
   - What surprised you about how programming concepts apply in these fields?
   - Could you see yourself in any of these roles in the future?
   - What additional skills would complement your programming knowledge in these fields?

2. Create a simple "career interest" ranking of the roles from most to least interesting to you personally.

3. For your top two roles, note:
   - What aspects of the role appeal to you
   - What skills you already have that would be valuable
   - What skills you would need to develop
   - Possible steps to explore this career path further

## Variations

### Modified Roles for Different Contexts
Adapt the professional roles to match careers that are particularly relevant in your region or community. For example, in coastal areas, you might include roles related to fishing or marine resource management.

### Technology Level Variations
Explore how these same roles would work with different levels of technology access:
- Paper-based systems only
- Basic mobile phones but no computers
- Limited computer access
- Full technology access
This helps show how computational thinking remains valuable regardless of technology level.

### Career History Narratives
Instead of solving current problems, create career history narratives that tell the story of how these professionals used computational thinking to advance in their careers over time.

### Cross-Role Collaboration
For group activities, assign different roles to different people, then create scenarios that require collaboration between multiple roles (e.g., the Agricultural Systems Designer and Environmental Monitoring Technician working together on a sustainable farming initiative).

## Extension Activities

### 1. Professional Interview Project
If possible, identify and interview someone working in a field that interests you who uses computational thinking in their work. Document how they apply these skills in their profession.

### 2. Career Pathway Map
Create a visual "pathway map" showing the potential steps from your current skills and situation to a career that interests you, including educational opportunities, intermediate roles, and skill development needs.

### 3. Job Description Creation
Write a detailed job description for a role that combines computational thinking with another field that interests you, creating a hybrid position that might not yet formally exist but that addresses real needs.

### 4. Day-in-the-Life Simulation
Choose your favorite role and create a detailed "day in the life" simulation, describing the tasks, challenges, and computational thinking applications throughout a typical workday.

## Reflection Questions

1. How has this activity changed your understanding of what "programming careers" look like?
2. Which programming concepts seem most universally valuable across different professions?
3. What non-technical skills seem important to complement programming knowledge in professional contexts?
4. How might your unique background and experiences be an advantage in certain programming-related roles?
5. Which aspects of computational thinking do you most enjoy applying, and how might that influence your career interests?

## Connection to Programming

This role-playing activity demonstrates that programming knowledge extends far beyond traditional software development roles. The computational thinking skills you've been developing—decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithm design, and abstraction—are valuable across countless professions.

Many people who use programming concepts professionally never call themselves "programmers" or "coders." Instead, they are healthcare workers, educators, agricultural specialists, logistics experts, community organizers, and environmental stewards who happen to use computational thinking as a powerful tool in their work.

As you continue your programming journey, keep in mind that your knowledge can be applied wherever your other interests and talents lead you. The ability to think systematically, design clear processes, work effectively with data, and create step-by-step solutions creates value in virtually any field—meaning your programming skills can be a valuable asset regardless of your ultimate career path.
