5. **Regional Technology Asset Map**: Research and document technology companies, education providers, and opportunities in your broader region (beyond your immediate community).

## Connection to Programming

This career exploration process uses many of the same analytical approaches that programmers apply to complex problems:

1. **Systematic Analysis**: Breaking down the complex career landscape into manageable components.

2. **Gap Analysis**: Identifying the difference between current and desired states, just as programmers identify the gap between current and required functionality.

3. **Scenario Planning**: Considering multiple possible paths and outcomes, similar to how programmers design flexible systems.

4. **Requirements Gathering**: Identifying what's needed for success, just as programmers gather requirements before development.

5. **Iterative Development**: Creating a career plan that can evolve with new information, similar to agile development methodologies.

These analytical thinking skills will serve you well both in career planning and in programming itself.

## Reflection Questions
