For extremely limited resources:
- Create the roadmap entirely on a single sheet of paper
- Focus on paper-based learning activities and planning
- Emphasize community connection for resource sharing

### Group Version

For learning communities:
- Create individual roadmaps, then share with the group
- Identify common goals and resource needs
- Develop a community learning calendar
- Assign different learning topics to members who will then teach others

### Visual Version

For visual thinkers:
- Create a mind map or visual journey representation
- Use symbols and colors to represent different types of goals and activities
- Include visual milestones and progress indicators

## Extension Activities

1. **Resource Network Map**: Create a visual map of all the people, places, and resources in your community that could support your learning journey.

2. **Learning Experiments Log**: Design a system to track small "learning experiments" (trying different approaches or resources) and their outcomes.

3. **Skills Inventory**: Create a detailed inventory of both technical and non-technical skills that will support your programming journey, with plans to develop each one.

4. **Technology Access Plan**: If technology access is limited, create a detailed plan for maximizing the value of the access you do have.

5. **Digital Transition Strategy**: Design a specific strategy for transitioning from paper-based programming concepts to digital implementation when you have computer access.

## Connection to Programming

This planning approach mirrors how programmers develop software:

1. **Requirements gathering**: Your self-assessment identifies what you need and want
2. **Resource assessment**: You evaluate what you have to work with
3. **System architecture**: Your roadmap structures how components will work together
4. **Milestone planning**: You break the large goal into achievable components
5. **Testing strategy**: Your review points help you identify and fix problems
6. **Documentation**: Your notebook becomes a record of decisions and progress

By approaching your learning journey with this systematic mindset, you're already practicing important programming skills.

Remember that like good software development, your learning roadmap should be flexible—ready to adapt to new information and changing circumstances while maintaining progress toward your core goals.
