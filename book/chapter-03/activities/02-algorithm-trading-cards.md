# Activity: Algorithm Trading Cards

## Overview
Algorithm Trading Cards turn algorithms into collectible, shareable items that you can create, exchange, and learn from. By creating your own algorithm cards for everyday tasks and trading them with others, you'll build a library of problem-solving approaches while learning how different people think about the same problems.

## Learning Objectives
- Create clear, concise algorithms for common tasks
- Recognize different approaches to solving the same problem
- Build a collection of reusable algorithms
- Practice reading and interpreting others' algorithms
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in different algorithm designs

## Materials Needed
- Notebook paper cut into card-sized pieces (approximately 3×5 inches or 8×12 cm)
- Pencils, pens, or markers
- Scissors for cutting cards
- Optional: card template drawn on the first page of your notebook
- Optional: envelopes or containers for storing card collections

## Time Required
Initial creation: 30-45 minutes
Ongoing activity: 15-20 minutes per trading session

## Instructions

### Part 1: Creating Your First Algorithm Cards

1. Cut your notebook paper into at least 10 card-sized pieces
2. Design a simple template for your cards with:
   - A title area at the top
   - A main section for the algorithm steps
   - A small area at the bottom for your name and the date
3. Choose 5 simple, everyday tasks to create algorithms for, such as:
   - How to tie shoelaces
   - How to make a sandwich
   - How to wash hands properly
   - How to draw a simple shape (star, house, etc.)
   - How to play a simple game (tic-tac-toe, rock-paper-scissors)
4. For each task:
   - Write a clear title at the top of the card
   - Number your steps (aim for 5-10 steps per card)
   - Make each step clear and specific
   - Add your name and the date at the bottom

### Part 2: Testing Your Algorithms

1. Choose one of your algorithm cards
2. Find a friend or family member who will follow your algorithm exactly
3. Observe them as they follow your instructions step by step
4. Note any points of confusion or misinterpretation
5. Based on your observations, create an improved version of that algorithm on a new card

### Part 3: Trading and Collecting

1. Meet with friends who have also created algorithm cards
2. Take turns presenting your algorithms to the group
3. Trade cards with each other
4. Try following the algorithms you've received
5. Provide constructive feedback to help improve each other's algorithms
6. Keep your growing collection in your notebook or a special envelope

### Part 4: Building Your Algorithm Library

1. As your collection grows, organize your cards into categories:
   - Everyday tasks
   - Math operations
   - Games and fun
   - Problem-solving strategies
   - Your own custom categories
2. Create "index cards" that list what cards you have in each category
3. Look for gaps in your collection and create new cards to fill them
4. Periodically review your collection to identify your favorite or most useful algorithms

### Part 5: Creating Advanced Cards

After you've created and traded several basic algorithm cards, try making more advanced ones:

1. **Decision Cards**: Create algorithms that include IF-THEN decision points
   - Example: "How to decide what to wear based on weather"
2. **Loop Cards**: Create algorithms that include repetition
   - Example: "How to search for a lost item"
3. **Subprocedure Cards**: Create algorithms that reference other algorithm cards
   - Example: "How to host a dinner party" might reference your "How to set a table" card
4. **Debugging Cards**: Create cards that focus on finding and fixing problems
   - Example: "How to troubleshoot a non-working flashlight"

### Part 6: Reflection

In your notebook, reflect on your algorithm card experience:

1. Which types of algorithms were easiest for you to create? Which were most difficult?
2. How did your algorithm-writing skills improve as you created more cards?
3. What did you learn from seeing how others wrote algorithms for the same tasks?
4. Which algorithms in your collection do you find most useful or interesting?
5. How might you use your algorithm card collection in the future?

## Example Algorithm Card

Here's an example of what an algorithm card might look like:

```

│   HOW TO MAKE A PAPER AIRPLANE    │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Start with a rectangular piece  │
│    of paper                        │
│ 2. Fold the paper in half          │
│    lengthwise, then unfold         │
│ 3. Fold the top corners down to    │

## Variations

### Algorithm Challenges

Create challenge cards where only the input and desired output are specified, but not the steps. For example:
- Input: 10 random numbers
- Output: The numbers arranged from smallest to largest

Trade these challenge cards and see what different algorithms people create to solve the same problem.

### Cultural Algorithms

Create algorithm cards for traditional practices, recipes, games, or crafts from different cultures. This helps preserve cultural knowledge while practicing algorithm creation.

### Visual Algorithm Cards

For visual learners, create cards that combine written steps with simple diagrams or symbols that illustrate each step of the process.

### Algorithm Card Game

Create a game where one person draws a card and has to execute the algorithm while others guess what task they're performing.

## Extension Activities

### Algorithm Mashup

1. Randomly select two algorithm cards from your collection
2. Try to create a new algorithm that combines elements of both
3. This exercise promotes creative thinking and recognition of shared patterns

### Algorithm Optimization Challenge

1. Choose one algorithm card from your collection
2. Challenge yourself to rewrite it using fewer steps while maintaining clarity
3. Compare the original and optimized versions

### Collaborative Algorithms

1. Form a group of 3-5 people
2. Choose a complex task (like planning an event)
3. Each person contributes one section of the overall algorithm
4. Combine your work into a "master algorithm card" that shows the complete process

### Digital Collection

If you have occasional access to a computer:
1. Create a digital version of your favorite algorithm cards
2. Share them with friends or community members who might find them useful
3. Build a community algorithm library

## Connection to Programming

The Algorithm Trading Cards activity connects to programming in several important ways:

1. **Reusable Components**: Just as programmers build libraries of code they can reuse, your algorithm cards become a personal library of solutions.

2. **Abstraction**: The process of breaking down complex tasks into simple, specific steps mirrors how programmers approach problems.

3. **Documentation**: Clear algorithm cards serve the same purpose as well-documented code—they help others understand and use your work.

4. **Iteration**: The process of testing, getting feedback, and improving your algorithm cards is similar to the software development cycle.

5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Trading cards and learning from others' approaches is similar to how programmers collaborate and learn from each other's code.

As you continue your programming journey, your algorithm card collection will serve as a concrete representation of your growing understanding of computational thinking.
