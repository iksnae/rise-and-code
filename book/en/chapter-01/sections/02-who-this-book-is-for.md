# Who This Book Is For

## You, Specifically

This book was written for **you.**

Not some imaginary "perfect student." Not someone who already knows about computers. Not a genius or a prodigy.

You.

Whoever you are, wherever you are, whatever your situation—this book is designed with YOU in mind.

## Different Stories, Same Door

Let me tell you about some people who picked up this book:

### Maya's Story

Maya is 14. She lives in a city, goes to school, and is curious about how the world works. One day she wondered: *"How do apps actually decide what to show me?"* She's never programmed before. She doesn't have her own computer. But she's smart, she asks questions, and she wanted to understand.

This book is for Maya.

### Ahmed's Story

Ahmed is 45. He's been incarcerated for several years. He spends a lot of time in his cell. One day, a teacher brought this book to the library. Ahmed thought: *"What's programming? I've never done anything like that."* He'd never touched a computer. He has time, and he wants to learn something that matters.

This book is for Ahmed.

### Zainab's Story

Zainab is 9. She lives in a small village. Her school doesn't have computers. Her family doesn't have money for fancy tools. But Zainab watches her parents run the family farm, and she asks a LOT of questions about how things work. She wants to understand everything.

This book is for Zainab.

### James's Story

James is 68. He's retired. His grandkids are always talking about coding and apps, and he wants to understand what they're doing. He's not tech-savvy, but he's curious. He's smart. He just wants to learn what this "programming" thing actually IS.

This book is for James.

### Kai's Story

Kai is 11. Kai has a learning difference that makes reading and concentrating hard. Kai's parent found this book because it doesn't require a computer—just pen and paper. Kai's confused sometimes, but Kai's not dumb. Kai just learns differently. When Kai read the first section, Kai felt: *"Oh, this is actually for ME."*

This book is for Kai.

## What They All Have in Common

Maya, Ahmed, Zainab, James, and Kai don't have much in common on the surface. Different ages. Different places. Different reasons for wanting to learn.

But they all have this in common:

✨ **They're curious**  
✨ **They're willing to try**  
✨ **They deserve to learn**  
✨ **They have smart brains**  

And that's who this book is for.

## What You Won't Find in This Book

**You won't find:**
- Judgment about your age, your background, or where you are
- Complicated technical jargon that makes you feel stupid
- A computer requirement (this whole book works without one)
- Pressure to finish quickly or "get it right"
- The assumption that you've done this before

## What You Will Find

**You will find:**
- A warm voice that talks TO you, not AT you
- Real stories and real problems that matter
- Concepts that build on what you already know
- Activities that feel like play, not homework
- Permission to go at your own pace
- A book that treats you like your brain matters (because it does)

## You Belong Here

Maybe you picked this book up because:
- You're curious about how things work
- You want to understand computers (or learn that you don't need them as much as you think)
- You're in a place where education is hard to access
- You have time and you want to use it well
- Someone you trust told you this book is good
- You just want to try something new

**Whatever your reason: You belong here.**

This book wasn't written for "smart people" or "computer people." It was written for people who are curious, who want to learn, and who deserve access to real knowledge.

That's you.

## A Note on Accessibility

This book works for people with different needs:

**No computer needed** — The whole book works with just pencil and paper.

**No expensive materials** — Most activities use things you probably have: coins, paper, things from around you.

**Different ways of learning** — Some people like to read carefully. Some like to jump around. Some need to move around while they learn. That's all OK here.

**Different abilities** — If you have ADHD, dyslexia, or a learning difference, this book can work for you. If you're blind or have low vision, the activities can be adapted. If English isn't your first language, the words are simple and the ideas are clear.

**Different ages** — An 8-year-old can learn from this. So can an 80-year-old. Everyone finds something here.

**Different backgrounds** — Whether you're in a prison, a refugee camp, a poor neighborhood, a wealthy suburb, or anywhere else—this book is yours.

## One More Thing

You might be thinking: *"I'm not a 'computer person.' I'm not smart about this stuff."*

Here's the truth: **Programming isn't about computers. It's about thinking clearly.** And you probably already do that.

Every time you:
- Plan your day
- Teach someone something
- Follow a recipe
- Figure out a problem
- Explain something complicated

...you're using programming thinking.

This book just helps you get BETTER at it.

## Ready to Begin

By the end of this book, you'll understand:
- How logical thinking works
- How to break big problems into small steps
- How data gets organized
- How patterns repeat in the world
- Why all of this matters

And you'll feel something shift. You'll look at the world differently. You'll notice systems and patterns everywhere. You'll realize: *"I can think about this. I can understand this."*

That's the real power of programming thinking.

Not computers. Not code.

**Clear thinking. Problem-solving. Understanding.**

That's what this book teaches. That's what YOU'RE about to learn.

## Next Up

In the next section, we'll talk about how to use this book. We'll explore what you need (spoiler: not much), and how to get the most out of it.

**But first, know this:**

You were meant to read this book. Your curiosity brought you here. Your brain is ready to learn.

Let's go.
