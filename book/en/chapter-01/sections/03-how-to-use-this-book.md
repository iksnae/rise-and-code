# How to Use This Book

## The Basic Idea

This book has two parts that work together:

1. **The book itself** — Stories, explanations, ideas
2. **Activity sheets** — Printable exercises you can do and share

You read the book. You do the activities. That's it. Simple.

But there are some ways to get the most out of it.

## The Workbook Model: Why It's Different

Most books have activities embedded inside them. You do the activity, write in the book, and it's done. The book gets worn out. One person uses it.

**This book is different.**

The activities are on separate sheets. Here's why that matters:

**For you:**
- The sheet is yours to write on with pen or pencil
- You can erase and do it again
- You can give it to someone else when you're done
- Multiple people can learn from one book

**For your community:**
- One book can reach many learners
- Sheets can be photocopied (cheap and easy)
- Activities can be adapted for different people
- The book stays fresh for years

**It's designed to be shared.**

## What You Need

Here's the beautiful part: **You don't need much.**

- [ ] This book (or even just one chapter)
- [ ] Paper (blank or lined, doesn't matter)
- [ ] A pencil or pen
- [ ] Your brain
- [ ] Optional: Common stuff like coins, dice, or string for some activities

**That's it. You're ready.**

No computer required. No Wi-Fi needed. No special tools or software. Just you, this book, and paper.

## How to Read This Book

**You have choices:**

### Option 1: Read Straight Through
Start at Chapter 1, read to the end. Each chapter builds on the one before it. This works great if you want the full experience.

**Time:** Maybe 2-3 hours per chapter, done over several days or weeks.

### Option 2: Pick and Choose
Jump to a chapter that interests you. Each chapter stands alone if you need it to. Maybe you're interested in Logic? Go to Chapter 2. Want to learn about Loops? Chapter 5 is waiting.

**Time:** Do one chapter whenever you want.

### Option 3: Use This as a Group
Read Chapter 1 together. Discuss. Do the activity sheet as a group. Then move to the next chapter.

**Time:** 1-2 hours per chapter as a group.

**There's no "wrong" way. You're in charge.**

## The Companion Notebook

You'll get the most out of this book if you keep a notebook as you read.

**What to put in it:**
- Questions you have (you don't need answers right away—just wonder)
- Things that confuse you (write them down, they might make sense later)
- Examples YOU find of the concepts (your own stories)
- Rough answers to activities (rough is fine)
- Thoughts and feelings as you learn

**Why?**
- Writing helps your brain remember
- A notebook is YOUR space to think
- You can look back and see how much you've learned
- It's proof that you're learning

**Important:** Your notebook doesn't need to be neat. Messy is OK. Rough drafts are perfect. This is for YOU, not for anyone else.

## How Activities Work

When you see an activity in this book, here's what happens:

1. **Read the setup** in the book (usually a story or challenge)
2. **Get the activity sheet** (from your teacher, printed out, or from the back of the book)
3. **Do the activity** with a pencil (so you can erase if you want)
4. **Reflect** on what you learned
5. **Optional: Share it** with someone or teach them what you learned

**Important:** There are no "right answers" here. There are just good thinking and learning.

Some activities ask you to observe something. Others ask you to create something. Some ask you to think about something differently. None of them have one correct answer.

Your thinking is what matters.

## Pace Yourself

**You don't have to rush.**

Some people will read a chapter in one sitting. Others will take a week. Some will do one activity per day.

**All of that is great.**

If something confuses you, you can:
- Read it again
- Move on and come back later
- Ask someone about it
- Just keep going—it might make sense next chapter

There's no deadline. There's no grade. There's just you learning at your pace.

## Using This Book Alone vs. With Others

### Alone
**Pros:**
- Go at your own pace
- Read when you want
- Privacy to think and wonder
- Notebook is yours alone

**Tips:**
- Write everything down
- Read sections twice if they confuse you
- Talk through ideas out loud (yes, really)
- Take breaks when you need them

### With a Group or Class
**Pros:**
- Bounce ideas off others
- Learn from different perspectives
- Activities are more fun
- Someone can answer your questions

**Tips:**
- Everyone might understand differently—that's good
- Share your thinking, listen to others
- Do activities together or separately
- Have someone lead who's read ahead (but they don't have to be an "expert")

### With a Teacher or Facilitator
**Pros:**
- Someone can help when you're stuck
- Can discuss deeper questions
- Can get feedback
- Can do more complex activities

**Tips:**
- Tell them what confuses you
- Ask questions
- Do your own thinking first before asking for help
- Activities work best when you try before getting help

## Dealing with Confusion

**What if I don't understand something?**

That's completely normal. Programming thinking is new. It's OK to be confused.

**Here's what you do:**

1. **Read it again** — Sometimes it clicks the second time
2. **Look at examples** — Real-world examples help
3. **Do the activity** — Sometimes doing it makes it clear
4. **Skip it** — Seriously. Keep reading. It might make sense in the next chapter
5. **Ask someone** — A friend, teacher, or facilitator
6. **Come back** — You can always revisit a chapter later

**You won't break anything by being confused. And you won't get dumber by asking.**

## How Long Does This Take?

**Per chapter:** 2-3 hours (reading + activity)
**Whole book:** 20-30 hours over several weeks

But here's the thing: **You don't have to do it all at once.**

Some people do a chapter per week. Some do one per month. Some do chapters out of order.

**The pace is yours.**

## Using This Book Multiple Times

**You can come back to this book.**

Maybe you read it once, then a year later you want to refresh. You can do the activities again.

The activity sheets are designed so you can:
- Do them multiple times (use a fresh sheet each time)
- Do them with different people
- Do them at different stages of your learning

**This book doesn't wear out. You can keep using it.**

## Accessibility

**If you have different needs, this book adapts:**

- **Can't see well?** Activities don't require tiny font. Ask someone to read parts out loud. Activities can be done verbally
- **Hard to read?** The language is simple. Pictures and examples help. Ask for help—that's what the sheets are for
- **Need to move around?** Do activities while walking, standing, or moving. Movement helps learning
- **Get bored easily?** Jump around the book. Do activities in different order. The book is flexible
- **Are deaf or hard of hearing?** All activities work visually or on paper. No audio required

**Tell someone if something isn't working. We can figure it out.**

## One More Thing: You're Not Alone

Maybe you're doing this book alone in your cell. Maybe you're in a classroom with 30 other people. Maybe you're at home with your family.

Wherever you are: thousands of other people are doing this too.

You're part of a movement of people learning to think clearly without needing expensive technology.

**That's powerful.**

## Ready to Go

You've read:
- Why programming matters
- Who this book is for
- How to use it

**Now you're ready for the real work.**

In the next chapters, you'll meet Logic, Recipe, Data, and Patterns. You'll learn to think like a programmer.

But first, you've got to do one thing:

**Stop here and do the activities for this chapter.** The sheets are coming up. Take them seriously (but have fun too). This is where your learning starts.

See you on the other side.
