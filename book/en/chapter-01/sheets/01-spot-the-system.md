**TIME:** 20-30 minutes

## WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

Programming is about noticing how things work and thinking about *why* they work that way. This activity teaches you to OBSERVE like a programmer. When you notice systems, you're already thinking about programming.

## YOUR MISSION

Look around your world. Find **5 things that follow a pattern or seem to work like a system.**

They can be big or small. Inside or outside. At home, school, work, or anywhere you are.

For each system, answer these three questions:

### SYSTEM #1

**What is it?** (Describe it briefly)  
_____________________________________________

**Does it do the same thing every time?** (Circle one)  
YES    /    NO

**Does it help people do something?** (Circle one)  
YES    /    NO

**Sketch or describe it below:**  
(Stick figures and rough drawings are perfect!)

```
[Space for drawing]

### SYSTEM #2

**What is it?**  
_____________________________________________

**Does it do the same thing every time?**  
YES    /    NO

**Does it help people do something?**  
YES    /    NO

**Sketch or describe it:**

```

### SYSTEM #3

**What is it?**  
_____________________________________________

**Does it do the same thing every time?**  
YES    /    NO

**Does it help people do something?**  
YES    /    NO

**Sketch or describe it:**

```

### SYSTEM #4

**What is it?**  
_____________________________________________

**Does it do the same thing every time?**  
YES    /    NO

**Does it help people do something?**  
YES    /    NO

**Sketch or describe it:**

### SYSTEM #5

**What is it?**  
_____________________________________________

**Does it do the same thing every time?**  
YES    /    NO

**Does it help people do something?**  
YES    /    NO

**Sketch or describe it:**

## REFLECTION QUESTIONS

**1. What surprised you about the systems you found?**

_____________________________________________

**2. If ONE of these systems broke (stopped working the way it's supposed to), what would happen?**

## EXTRA CHALLENGE (If You Want More)

Pick ONE of the systems you found. Can you teach a friend how it works in just 2-3 minutes?

**Did they understand?** (Circle one)  
YES    /    SORT OF    /    NO

**What was hardest to explain?**

## YOU DID IT! 🎉

You just completed your first programming thinking activity. You practiced OBSERVATION—noticing how systems work.

That's exactly how programmers think.

**Return this sheet when you're done so the next person can find their own systems.**
