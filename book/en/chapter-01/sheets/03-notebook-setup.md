# ACTIVITY SHEET: Chapter 1 / Setting Up Your Coding Notebook

**Concept:** A notebook is where you capture your thinking as you learn programming. It's YOUR space.

---

## MATERIALS NEEDED

☐ This sheet  
☐ A pencil or pen  
☐ A blank notebook (any notebook—composition, spiral, fancy, doesn't matter)  

**TIME:** 15-20 minutes

---

## WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

Throughout this book, you'll discover new ideas. A notebook helps you:
- Remember what you learned
- Capture confusing questions
- Find your own examples
- Watch yourself grow
- Prove how much you know

This sheet helps you set up that notebook.

## YOUR CODING NOTEBOOK

This isn't like a diary. It's not for private secrets. It's a **thinking space.**

Think of it like a scientist's lab notebook—where they write down observations, experiments, and ideas.

---

## SETTING IT UP

Take your notebook. Flip to the first page.

Write this:

```
═════════════════════════════════════════════
        MY PROGRAMMING THINKING NOTEBOOK
════════════════════════════════════════════

Name: _____________________________

Date started: ______________________

═════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## WHAT TO WRITE IN IT

**As you read each chapter, capture:**

📝 **New ideas**
- "This is what algorithms are"
- "I didn't know systems were everywhere"

❓ **Questions**
- "I don't understand why Logic needs yes/no"
- "What happens if..."

💡 **Examples YOU find**
- "I found this system: [your example]"
- "I use loops every time I..."

✍️ **Rough answers**
- Answers to activities (rough is fine!)
- Your thinking process
- Mistakes you made and learned from

💬 **Your own connections**
- "This reminds me of..."
- "This is like how my brain..."

## SAMPLE ENTRY

Here's what a notebook entry COULD look like:

```
═════════════════════════════════════════════
Chapter 1 / Section 1 - Why Programming Matters
Date: Feb 17, 2026

SYSTEMS I FOUND:
1. Traffic light (changes color automatically)
2. School bell (rings at same time every day)
3. My mom's routine (always the same steps)

CONFUSION:
- What does "algorithm" really mean?
- Is programming only for computers?

MY THOUGHT:
Programming thinking isn't just computers.
It's about clear steps. I do this when I:
- Follow a recipe
- Teach someone something new
- Organize my stuff

QUESTIONS FOR NEXT TIME:
- How does the computer KNOW when to follow
  the algorithm?
- Can I teach an animal an algorithm?

## IMPORTANT NOTES

Your notebook:
- ✅ Can be messy
- ✅ Can have crossed-out words
- ✅ Can have doodles
- ✅ Can have rough drafts
- ✅ Is YOUR space to think
- ❌ Doesn't need to be perfect
- ❌ Doesn't need to be "right"
- ❌ Won't be graded

**This is for YOU. Not for anyone else.**

---

## FIRST ENTRY: RIGHT NOW

Use the next page of your notebook to write your first entry.

Include:

**Title:**  
Chapter 1, Section 1 - First Thoughts

**What I already know about computers/programming:**  
(Even if you think you know nothing, write something)

**What I want to understand:**  
(What made you pick up this book?)

**One system I found:**  
(From the first activity)

**One question I have:**  
(It can be silly. Questions are good.)

## REFLECTION: YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A LEARNER

When you write in your notebook, you're doing what:
- Scientists do in lab notebooks
- Writers do in journals
- Artists do in sketchbooks
- Programmers do in their notes

**You're joining a tradition of thinkers.**

---

## USING YOUR NOTEBOOK

**As you go through the book:**
- Write after each chapter
- Capture ideas when they hit you (don't wait)
- Go back and read old entries (see how much you've learned!)
- Draw diagrams if they help
- Write messy if that's faster
- Explain ideas to yourself like you're teaching someone else

---

## EXTRA: MAKE IT PERSONAL

If you want, decorate your notebook cover:
- Draw something
- Paste pictures
- Write a quote that inspires you
- Make it YOUR space

(Optional, but it helps make it feel like yours)

---

## YOU DID IT! 🎉

Your notebook is ready. You're ready. You're about to learn something big.

**Every great thinker started with a blank notebook and a question.**

Now it's your turn.
