# ACTIVITY SHEET: Chapter 1 / Your First Algorithm

**Concept:** An algorithm is just a set of clear step-by-step instructions. You already know how to make them!

---

## MATERIALS NEEDED

☐ This sheet  
☐ A pencil or pen  
☐ Optional: Ask someone to follow your instructions to see if they work  

**TIME:** 20-30 minutes

---

## WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

An **algorithm** is just a fancy word for "step-by-step instructions." You make algorithms all the time without even knowing it. This activity shows you how to write one clearly.

## EXAMPLE: Making Tea

Here's an algorithm for making tea:

1. Get a cup
2. Fill the cup with water
3. Boil the water
4. Put a tea bag in the cup
5. Pour the hot water over the tea bag
6. Wait 3-5 minutes
7. Remove the tea bag
8. Add milk or sugar if you want
9. Drink it!

**That's an algorithm.**

It's not complicated. It's just: "Here's how to do this, step by step."

---

## YOUR TURN: Write an Algorithm

Pick something YOU do regularly. Something simple. Here are ideas:

- Making your breakfast
- Brushing your teeth
- Getting ready in the morning
- Doing a chore you know well
- Playing a game
- Something else you do

## **WHAT I'M GOING TO TEACH SOMEONE:**

_______________________________________

---

## **MY ALGORITHM:**

Write the steps. Use clear, simple words. Start with "1." and number each step.

```
1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

7.

8.

9.

10.
```

## **TEST YOUR ALGORITHM:**

This is important! Ask someone to follow your steps EXACTLY as you wrote them.

Did they succeed? (Circle one)  
**YES** / **SORT OF** / **NO**

---

## **WHAT HAPPENED?**

If they succeeded great job!

If it was confusing, that's OK. That's the whole point. This shows you:
- Where your instructions were unclear
- What you forgot to mention
- How computers feel when instructions aren't clear enough

---

## **MAKE IT BETTER:**

Rewrite your algorithm, fixing any confusing parts. You can use the back of this sheet.

## REFLECTION

**1. What was hardest about writing clear steps?**

_________________________________________________

_________________________________________________

**2. What would happen if you skipped one step?**

_________________________________________________

_________________________________________________

**3. Could a computer follow your algorithm? Why or why not?**

## EXTRA CHALLENGE

Write an algorithm for something MORE complicated:
- A game with rules
- A recipe
- How to teach someone something
- How to solve a problem

The harder the task, the more steps you'll need. That's the challenge!

---

## YOU DID IT! 🎉

You just wrote an algorithm. That's exactly what programmers do—they write step-by-step instructions that computers (or people) can follow.

**Return this sheet so someone else can try.**
