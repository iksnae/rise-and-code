# Crafting Repetitive Tasks

## Introduction

In the previous section, we learned what loops are and why they're important. Now, let's explore how to design and create our own loops to solve specific problems. The art of "crafting" loops involves identifying when repetition is needed, choosing the right type of loop, and structuring the loop elements correctly.

## Recognizing Tasks That Need Loops

The first step in using loops effectively is to recognize when a task would benefit from repetition. Here are some telltale signs that a loop might be the right solution:

1. **Multiple similar actions**: You need to perform the same action multiple times
2. **Processing a collection**: You need to work with each item in a list, set, or other collection
3. **Unknown repetitions**: You need to continue a process until a condition is met
4. **Accumulating results**: You need to build up a result through multiple steps
5. **Pattern generation**: You need to create a pattern with repeating elements

Think about washing clothes by hand. You wouldn't write separate instructions for each item of clothing. Instead, you'd use a loop: "For each dirty garment, wash it, rinse it, and hang it to dry."

## Choosing the Right Loop Type

Once you've identified that a loop is needed, the next step is to choose the right type of loop. Here's a simple decision guide:

- **Use a FOR loop when**:
  - You know exactly how many iterations you need
  - You're working through a collection of items
  - You want to count up or down by specific intervals

- **Use a WHILE loop when**:
  - You don't know how many iterations you'll need in advance
  - The loop should continue until a specific condition is met
  - The number of iterations depends on user input or other data

Let's see some examples of tasks and which loop types would be appropriate:

| Task | Appropriate Loop Type | Why |
|------|----------------------|-----|
| Sum the numbers from 1 to 10 | FOR | We know exactly how many numbers to add |
| Read lines from a book until finding a specific word | WHILE | We don't know how many lines we'll need to read |
| Process each student's score in a class | FOR EACH | We're working with a collection of scores |
| Keep rolling a die until getting a 6 | WHILE | We don't know how many rolls it will take |
| Count down from 10 to 1 | FOR | We know exactly how many numbers to count |

## Designing Loop Components

Every well-crafted loop consists of four main components. Let's explore how to design each one:

### 1. Initialization

The initialization sets up any variables needed for the loop before it starts. Common initializations include:

- Setting a counter variable to its starting value
- Preparing an accumulator variable to collect results
- Defining an empty collection to fill
- Setting a flag variable to track state

For example:
```
SET sum = 0                   # Accumulator for summing values
SET counter = 1               # Counter starting at 1
SET found = false             # Flag to track if we found something
SET result = ""               # Empty string to build up
```

### 2. Condition

The condition is the test that determines whether the loop should continue or stop. A good condition:

- Eventually becomes false (to avoid infinite loops)
- Clearly relates to the task's completion
- Is simple enough to understand at a glance

For example:
```
counter <= 10                 # Continue until we've processed 10 items
sum < 100                     # Continue until the sum reaches 100
NOT found                     # Continue until we find what we're looking for
length(input) > 0             # Continue while there's still input to process
```

### 3. Loop Body

The body contains the instructions that are executed during each iteration. When designing the body:

- Focus on what happens in a single iteration
- Keep it focused on a single purpose
- Make sure it moves the loop toward completion

For example:
```
Print counter
SET sum = sum + counter
IF item == target THEN SET found = true
SET result = result + current_char
```

### 4. Update

The update changes the loop variables to prepare for the next iteration. Good updates:

- Move the loop closer to completion
- Typically change the variable used in the condition
- May process the next item or increment a counter

For example:
```
SET counter = counter + 1
SET current = next_item
SET index = index + step_size
```

## Putting It All Together

Now, let's combine these components to craft complete loops for different tasks.

### Example 1: Summing Numbers

Task: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n (where n is provided)

```
# Initialization
SET sum = 0
SET current = 1

# Loop with condition, body, and update
WHILE current <= n
    SET sum = sum + current
    SET current = current + 1
END WHILE

# Result is in the sum variable
```

### Example 2: Finding a Value

Task: Determine if a value exists in a collection

```
# Initialization
SET found = false
SET index = 0

# Loop with condition, body, and update
WHILE index < LENGTH(collection) AND NOT found
    IF collection[index] == target_value THEN
        SET found = true
    END IF
    SET index = index + 1
END WHILE

# Result is in the found variable
```

### Example 3: Building a Pattern

Task: Create a string of alternating X and O characters of length n

```
# Initialization
SET pattern = ""
SET position = 0

# Loop with condition, body, and update
WHILE LENGTH(pattern) < n
    IF position % 2 == 0 THEN
        SET pattern = pattern + "X"
    ELSE
        SET pattern = pattern + "O"
    END IF
    SET position = position + 1
END WHILE

# Result is in the pattern variable
```

## Loop Design Patterns

Certain loop patterns appear so frequently that they're worth recognizing and learning. Here are some common ones:

### 1. The Counter Pattern

Used for counting or repeating a specific number of times:

```
SET counter = 1
WHILE counter <= max
    # Do something with counter
    SET counter = counter + 1
END WHILE
```

### 2. The Accumulator Pattern

Used for building up a result, like a sum or product:

```
SET total = 0  # starting value
FOR EACH number IN numbers
    SET total = total + number
END FOR
# total now contains the sum
```

### 3. The Search Pattern

Used for finding an item in a collection:

```
SET found = false
SET index = 0
WHILE index < LENGTH(items) AND NOT found
    IF items[index] == target THEN
        SET found = true
    END IF
    SET index = index + 1
END WHILE
```

### 4. The Filter Pattern

Used for collecting items that meet certain criteria:

```
SET results = []
FOR EACH item IN items
    IF meets_criteria(item) THEN
        ADD item TO results
    END IF
END FOR
```

### 5. The Transform Pattern

Used for creating a new collection based on transforming each item in an existing collection:

```
SET transformed = []
FOR EACH item IN items
    SET new_item = transform(item)
    ADD new_item TO transformed
END FOR
```

## Common Loop Challenges and Solutions

When crafting loops, you might encounter these common challenges:

### Challenge 1: Off-by-One Errors

This happens when your loop runs one too many or one too few times.

**Solution**: Double-check your initialization and condition. For a loop that should run from 1 to n:
- If using `<=`, start at 1
- If using `<`, start at 1 but run until n+1

Example:
```
# These two loops are equivalent:
FOR i = 1 TO n        # Runs from 1 to n (inclusive)
FOR i = 0 TO n-1      # Runs from 0 to n-1 (also n iterations)
```

### Challenge 2: Infinite Loops

A loop that never terminates because the condition is always true.

**Solution**: Ensure that:
- The update step actually changes the variables in the condition
- The condition can eventually become false
- No code inside the loop interferes with the update

Example:
```
# Problematic - might be infinite if input is always negative
WHILE number <= 0
    INPUT number
END WHILE

# Better - guarantees progress toward termination
DO
    INPUT number
WHILE number <= 0
```

### Challenge 3: Loop Variable Manipulation

Changing loop variables inside the loop body can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Solution**: Avoid modifying the loop control variable inside the loop body. If you need to track additional information, use separate variables.

```
# Problematic
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    IF some_condition THEN
        SET i = i + 2  # This disrupts the loop's flow
    END IF
END FOR

# Better
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    IF some_condition THEN
        # Use a different variable or just handle the condition
    END IF
END FOR
```

### Challenge 4: Complex Loop Termination

Sometimes you need multiple conditions to determine when to exit a loop.

**Solution**: Combine conditions with logical operators (AND, OR) or use a flag variable.

```
# Multiple exit conditions
WHILE counter < max AND NOT found AND error_count < 3
    # Loop body
END WHILE

# Using a flag
SET should_continue = true
WHILE should_continue
    # Do work
    IF exit_condition1 OR exit_condition2 THEN
        SET should_continue = false
    END IF
END WHILE
```

## Optimizing Loops

Once your loop is working, you can optimize it for efficiency or readability:

1. **Move constant calculations outside the loop**: If a calculation doesn't change between iterations, do it once before the loop.

2. **Combine loops when possible**: If you have multiple loops that process the same data, see if you can combine them.

3. **Break early when possible**: If you've found what you're looking for, exit the loop rather than continuing unnecessarily.

4. **Use appropriate loop types**: Choose the loop type that most directly expresses your intent.

5. **Use meaningful variable names**: Clear variable names make it easier to understand the loop's purpose.

Example of optimization:

```
# Before optimization
SET sum = 0
FOR i = 1 TO n
    SET square = i * i
    SET sum = sum + square
END FOR

# After optimization - calculation moved inside
SET sum = 0
FOR i = 1 TO n
    SET sum = sum + (i * i)
END FOR
```

## Activity: Loop Design Workshop

Let's practice designing loops for specific tasks:

1. Design a loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20
2. Design a loop to find the largest value in a list of numbers
3. Design a loop to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
4. Design a loop to reverse a string character by character
5. Design a loop to print a triangle pattern of asterisks:
   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```

For each task:
1. Identify the appropriate loop type
2. Design the initialization, condition, body, and update components
3. Trace through the execution for a small example to verify correctness
