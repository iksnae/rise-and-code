- Pencil and eraser
- Optional: colored pencils or markers
- Optional: index cards

## Time Required
30-45 minutes

## Instructions

### Part 1: Loop Pattern Inventory

1. In your notebook, create a reference table with these four common loop patterns:

   | Pattern Name | Purpose | Characteristics | Example |
   |--------------|---------|-----------------|---------|
   | Counting Loop | Repeating something a specific number of times | Has a counter variable that changes in a predictable way | Counting from 1 to 10 |
   | Collection Processing Loop | Processing each item in a collection | Visits every item exactly once | Checking each apple in a basket |
   | Accumulation Loop | Building up a result through repeated additions | Has a running total or accumulator variable | Summing all numbers from 1 to n |
   | Condition-Based Loop | Continuing until a specific condition is met | May run an unpredictable number of times | Searching until finding a match |

2. For each pattern, add a simple pseudocode example to your table:

   **Counting Loop:**
   ```
   SET counter = 1
   WHILE counter <= 10
       PRINT counter
       SET counter = counter + 1
   END WHILE
   ```

   **Collection Processing Loop:**
   ```
   FOR EACH item IN collection
       PROCESS item
   END FOR
   ```
   
   **Accumulation Loop:**
   ```
   SET total = 0
   FOR EACH number IN numbers
       SET total = total + number
   END FOR
   ```
   
   **Condition-Based Loop:**
   ```
   WHILE NOT found
       CHECK next item
       IF item matches target THEN
           SET found = true
       END IF
   END WHILE
   ```

### Part 2: Pattern Recognition in Daily Life

1. Observe your surroundings and routines to identify at least 2 examples of each loop pattern in everyday life:

   - **Counting Loop examples**: 
     - Doing 10 push-ups
     - Adding spices to a recipe one teaspoon at a time
   
   - **Collection Processing Loop examples**:
     - Checking each student's homework in a class
     - Washing each dish in the sink
   
   - **Accumulation Loop examples**:
     - Saving money each week until reaching a goal
     - Building a wall brick by brick
   
   - **Condition-Based Loop examples**:
     - Stirring a mixture until it reaches the right consistency
     - Looking for a lost item until you find it

2. For each example you identify:
   - Write down the key elements (what's being repeated, what changes each time)
   - Note any starting and ending conditions
   - Identify what would be the "loop variable" if this were programmed

3. Compare your examples with a partner (if possible) and add any interesting examples they found to your list.

### Part 3: Loop Pattern Translation

1. Choose three of your everyday examples from Part 2 (pick different pattern types)

2. For each chosen example, translate it into pseudocode following this template:
   ```
   # Initialization
   SET [variable(s)] = [starting value(s)]
   
   # Loop structure with condition
   WHILE/FOR [condition/range]
       # Loop body - what happens each time
       [actions]
       
       # Update - how variables change
       SET [variable] = [new value]
   END WHILE/FOR
   
   # Result (if applicable)
   ```

3. Make your pseudocode as specific and detailed as possible, as if you were instructing someone who has never done this activity before.

### Part 4: Pattern Matching Game

1. Create a set of 12 index cards (or paper slips):
   - On 4 cards, write the names of the loop patterns
   - On 4 cards, write examples of everyday activities using loops
   - On 4 cards, write simple pseudocode for different loops

2. Mix up all the cards and then try to match them in sets of three: pattern name + real-world example + pseudocode

3. If working with others, take turns drawing cards and making matches, or race to see who can match their cards the fastest.

### Part 5: Loop Pattern Analysis

For each of these scenarios, identify:
- Which loop pattern is most appropriate
- What the loop variable(s) would be
- The starting and ending conditions
- What actions would happen in each iteration

Scenarios:
1. A teacher grading a stack of 30 test papers
2. A cook adding salt to a soup, tasting after each addition until it's just right
3. Planting trees at 5-meter intervals along a 100-meter road
4. Checking each room in a house to make sure all windows are closed
5. Placing beads on a string to create a necklace of a specific length
6. Saving $50 each month until you have enough for a $500 purchase
7. Looking through a photo album until you find a specific photo
8. Following a dance routine that repeats the same 8 steps three times

### Part 6: Pattern Creation

1. Create your own everyday process that uses a loop structure. Design it to be:
   - Practical and useful
   - Easy to understand
   - Clearly repetitive

2. Write detailed instructions for your process, highlighting:
   - What needs to be done before starting the repetition
   - What gets repeated and how many times
   - How to know when to stop
   - What to do with the final result

3. Trade your process with a partner (if possible) and follow each other's instructions.

## Example: Loop Pattern Analysis

Let's analyze the scenario of "A cook adding salt to a soup, tasting after each addition until it's just right":

**Pattern Type**: Condition-Based Loop
- It continues until a condition is met (soup tastes right)
- The number of iterations isn't known in advance

**Loop Variables**:
- Current taste of the soup (subjective measure)
- Amount of salt added so far (could be tracked)

**Starting Condition**:
- Soup is prepared but under-salted
- A small amount of salt is ready to add

**Ending Condition**:
- Soup tastes "just right" (satisfies the taste condition)

**Actions in Each Iteration**:
1. Add a small, consistent amount of salt
2. Stir thoroughly to distribute
3. Taste the soup
4. Evaluate if more salt is needed

**Pseudocode**:
```
# Initialization
SET soup_tastes_right = false
SET salt_added = 0

# Loop structure
WHILE NOT soup_tastes_right
    # Add salt
    ADD small_amount_of_salt TO soup
    SET salt_added = salt_added + small_amount_of_salt
    
    # Stir and taste
    STIR soup
    TASTE soup
    
    # Evaluate
    IF taste IS satisfactory THEN
        SET soup_tastes_right = true
    END IF
END WHILE

# Result
DISPLAY "Soup is ready with " + salt_added + " salt added."
```

## Reflection Questions

After completing the activity, reflect on these questions:

1. Which loop patterns seem most common in your daily life?
2. How does identifying loop patterns help you think about problems more systematically?
3. What was challenging about translating everyday processes into pseudocode?
4. How might you use your understanding of loop patterns to be more efficient in daily tasks?
5. What similarities and differences did you notice between the various loop patterns?
6. How does breaking down repetitive tasks into loop structures change how you think about these tasks?

## Extension Activities

1. **Cross-Cultural Loop Patterns**: Research repetitive patterns in cultural practices like weaving, music, or dance from different cultures. Identify what loop patterns they follow and how they might be represented in code.

2. **Natural Cycles**: Investigate cycles in nature (seasons, water cycle, carbon cycle) and model them as loops, showing how different variables change throughout the cycle.

3. **Process Optimization**: Choose a repetitive task you do regularly and analyze it as a loop. Can you optimize it by changing the loop pattern or combining iterations?

4. **Algorithm Design**: Create an algorithm using multiple nested loops for a complex task like creating a woven pattern or organizing a complex event schedule.

## Connection to Programming

The pattern recognition skills you're developing in this activity directly transfer to programming:

- Professional programmers constantly look for repeating patterns that can be expressed as loops
- Understanding common loop patterns helps programmers choose the right tool for each task

As you continue your programming journey, these pattern recognition skills will help you write more efficient and elegant code, regardless of the specific programming language you use.

## Key Takeaways
