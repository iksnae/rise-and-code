# Basic Logic and Decision Making

## Meet Logic the Robot

Before we dive into how computers think, I want you to meet someone important.

**This is Logic.**

Logic is a robot who is incredibly helpful. But Logic has one very specific way of understanding the world:

**Logic only understands YES or NO.**

That's it. Logic can't handle "maybe." Logic can't understand "sort of." Logic doesn't do "probably" or "we'll see."

Logic is perfectly happy with YES. Logic is perfectly happy with NO.

Anything else? Logic gets confused.

## Logic's Superpower (and Limitation)

Here's the amazing part: **Because Logic only thinks in YES and NO, Logic is incredibly good at making decisions.**

Let me show you what I mean.

**You to your friend:** "Should we go to the park today?"  
**Friend's answer:** "Well... it's kind of nice outside, but maybe it'll rain later, and I'm a little tired, but I really want to see if my favorite spot is still there, and..."

Your friend is being honest. Real life is complicated. Decisions ARE messy.

**You to Logic:** "Should we go to the park today?"  
**Logic's answer:** "YES" or "NO"

Logic will give you an answer. Right away. No hemming and hawing.

**But here's the catch:** For Logic to answer, you have to ask the RIGHT question.

## Teaching Logic to Understand

So how do you talk to Logic?

You ask **YES or NO questions.**

### YES or NO Questions

These work with Logic:
- "Is it raining?" → YES or NO
- "Do I have time?" → YES or NO
- "Is the park open?" → YES or NO
- "Am I tired?" → YES or NO

Logic can answer these all day long.

### Questions That Confuse Logic

These don't work with Logic:
- "What should I do?" → Logic doesn't know. This isn't YES/NO.
- "How nice is the weather?" → Logic shrugs. This needs more than YES/NO.
- "Will it rain?" → Logic wants you to be specific. "In the next hour?" "Later today?"

When you ask Logic a non-YES/NO question, Logic looks at you confused.

"I don't understand," Logic says. "I only know YES or NO."

## Your Turn: Speaking Logic's Language

Let's practice turning messy questions into YES/NO questions that Logic understands.

### Example 1: Going to the Park

**Messy question:** "Should we go to the park?"

**YES/NO questions Logic can answer:**
- Is it raining? (YES/NO)
- Is the park open? (YES/NO)
- Do I have time? (YES/NO)
- Do I want to go? (YES/NO)

Once you ask all those YES/NO questions and get answers, then you can decide.

### Example 2: Eating Pizza

**Messy question:** "Should I eat pizza?"

**YES/NO questions Logic can answer:**
- Am I hungry? (YES/NO)
- Is there pizza? (YES/NO)
- Do I like pizza? (YES/NO)
- Do I have time to eat? (YES/NO)

### Example 3: Going to Bed

**Messy question:** "Is it time to sleep?"

**YES/NO questions Logic can answer:**
- Is it past 9 PM? (YES/NO)
- Am I tired? (YES/NO)
- Do I have school tomorrow? (YES/NO)
- Have I finished my tasks? (YES/NO)

## The Power of YES and NO: Truth and Falsehood

Now here's where it gets interesting.

In Logic's world, YES means **TRUE** and NO means **FALSE**.

These words mean the same thing:

**YES = TRUE = 1 (on)**  
**NO = FALSE = 0 (off)**

They're just different ways of saying the same thing.

Why does this matter?

Because once you translate everything to TRUE/FALSE, you can start combining answers.

## Combining Answers: AND, OR, NOT

When you ask Logic multiple YES/NO questions, you're building up information.

But sometimes you need to combine that information. That's where three powerful words come in:

**AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**.

These are Logic's tools for combining TRUE and FALSE answers.

### AND: Everything Must Be True

**AND** means: Both things have to be YES for the answer to be YES.

**Example:**
- Question 1: "Is it sunny?" → YES
- Question 2: "Do I have free time?" → YES
- Combined with AND: "Is it sunny AND do I have free time?" → YES

Both are YES, so the AND answer is YES.

But if one is NO:
- Question 1: "Is it sunny?" → YES
- Question 2: "Do I have free time?" → NO
- Combined with AND: "Is it sunny AND do I have free time?" → NO

One is NO, so the AND answer is NO.

### OR: At Least One Must Be True

**OR** means: If at least one thing is YES, the answer is YES.

**Example:**
- Question 1: "Am I hungry?" → YES
- Question 2: "Do I love ice cream?" → YES
- Combined with OR: "Am I hungry OR do I love ice cream?" → YES

At least one is YES (actually both are!), so the OR answer is YES.

Even if one is NO:
- Question 1: "Am I hungry?" → NO
- Question 2: "Do I love ice cream?" → YES
- Combined with OR: "Am I hungry OR do I love ice cream?" → YES

At least one is YES, so the OR answer is YES.

The only time OR is NO is when BOTH are NO.

### NOT: Flip It

**NOT** means: Switch YES to NO and NO to YES.

**Example:**
- Question: "Is it raining?" → YES
- NOT version: "Is it NOT raining?" → NO

You flipped the answer.

Another example:
- Question: "Do I like broccoli?" → NO
- NOT version: "Do I NOT like broccoli?" → YES

You flipped it again.

## Why Logic Matters

Here's the secret: **Computers think exactly like Logic.**

Your phone, your laptop, your watch—they all think in YES and NO (TRUE and FALSE).

Everything a computer does comes down to these simple decisions.

When your phone decides to:
- Turn on the screen
- Send a notification
- Play a song
- Block a call

...it's asking YES/NO questions and using AND, OR, and NOT to decide.

You, right now, without a computer, can think like Logic.

And when you do, you're thinking like a programmer.

## A Real-World Example: Your Morning

Let's see how Logic would help you decide about your morning.

**Decision:** Should I get up now?

**Logic's YES/NO questions:**
1. Is my alarm going off? (YES/NO)
2. Is it a school day? (YES/NO)
3. Do I feel rested? (YES/NO)
4. Do I have breakfast ready? (YES/NO)

**Using AND, OR, NOT:**
- "Should I get up?" = Alarm is going OFF AND it's a school day OR I'm already rested = YES

Logic would say: YES, get up.

Logic didn't have to think about it long. Logic just combined the YES/NO answers.

## What You're Learning

You're not learning computer code. You're learning how to think clearly.

When you:
- Break a problem into YES/NO questions
- Combine them with AND, OR, NOT
- Make a decision based on facts

...you're using the exact thinking that programmers use.

This is the foundation of everything. Logic before code. Thinking before programming.

And you just learned it.
