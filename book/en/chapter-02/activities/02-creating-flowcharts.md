# Activity: Creating Flowcharts for Everyday Decisions

## Overview
This activity helps you practice creating flowcharts to visualize decision-making processes. You'll learn how to map out logical steps for everyday scenarios, using standard flowchart symbols to represent different types of operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Use proper flowchart symbols to represent different operations
- Create clear, logical flows for decision-making processes
- Translate real-world scenarios into structured flowcharts
- Identify decision points and their potential outcomes
- Develop visual thinking skills that complement logical reasoning

## Materials Needed
- Your notebook (preferably with blank or grid pages)
- Pencil and eraser
- Ruler (optional but helpful)
- Colored pencils or pens (optional)
- Flowchart symbol templates (provided in this activity)

## Time Required
45-60 minutes

## Part 1: Flowchart Symbols and Conventions

### Standard Flowchart Symbols
In your notebook, create a reference page with these standard flowchart symbols:

1. **Start/End (Oval)**
   - Purpose: Marks the beginning or end of a process
   - Example text: "Start" or "End"

2. **Process (Rectangle)**
   - Purpose: Represents an action or operation
   - Example text: "Add sugar to mixture" or "Calculate total price"

3. **Decision (Diamond)**
   - Purpose: Indicates a decision point with multiple paths
   - Example text: "Is it raining?" or "Temperature > 30Â°C?"

4. **Input/Output (Parallelogram)**
   - Purpose: Shows data input or output
   - Example text: "Enter your name" or "Display total cost"

5. **Flow Lines (Arrows)**
   - Purpose: Connect symbols and show the sequence flow
   - Example: Simple arrows with direction pointers

6. **Connector (Circle)**
   - Purpose: Connects different parts of a flowchart, especially across pages
   - Example text: "A" or "1"

### Flowchart Conventions
Next to your symbols, note these important conventions:

1. Flow generally moves from top to bottom and left to right
2. Decision diamonds have exactly two exits (usually labeled "Yes/No" or "True/False")
3. Every path should eventually reach an end point
4. Lines should not cross if possible (use connectors if needed)
5. Use consistent spacing and sizing of symbols

## Part 2: Simple Flowchart Practice

### Step 1: Create a Morning Routine Flowchart
Draw a flowchart for a basic morning routine with these elements:
- Start when you wake up
- Decision about whether it's a weekday or weekend
- Different routines based on the day type
- End when you leave the house or start your day's activities

### Step 2: Add a Weather Decision
Enhance your flowchart to include a weather-related decision:
- Check if it's raining
- If yes, bring an umbrella
- If no, proceed normally

### Step 3: Review and Refine
Check your flowchart for:
- Proper symbol usage
- Clear flow direction
- Logical progression
- Complete paths (no dead ends)

## Part 3: Flowcharting Everyday Decisions

Now you'll create flowcharts for more complex everyday scenarios. Choose two of the following scenarios to create complete flowcharts for:

### Scenario 1: Deciding What to Eat for Dinner
Consider factors like:
- What ingredients are available?
- How much time do you have?
- Are you cooking for yourself or others?
- Do you have dietary restrictions?

### Scenario 2: Planning a Weekend Activity
Consider factors like:
- Weather conditions
- Budget constraints
- Who will be joining you
- Transportation options
- Time availability

### Scenario 3: Choosing a Gift for Someone
Consider factors like:
- What is your budget?
- What are their interests?
- Do they already have something similar?
- Is it a special occasion?
- Does it need to be delivered?

### Scenario 4: Troubleshooting a Non-Working Device
Create a flowchart for diagnosing why a device (like a mobile phone) isn't working, with steps like:
- Is it powered on?
- Is the battery charged?
- Are all connections secure?
- Has it been dropped or damaged?
- What error messages are showing?

## Part 4: Translating Stories to Flowcharts

### Step 1: Read the Story
Read this short scenario:

> Maria wants to make a cake for her friend's birthday. She checks if she has all the ingredients. If she has everything, she starts baking immediately. If she's missing something, she checks if the store is open. If the store is open, she goes shopping for the missing ingredients and then bakes the cake. If the store is closed, she decides to make cookies instead, as long as she has those ingredients. If she doesn't have the ingredients for cookies either, she'll buy a cake from the bakery tomorrow.

### Step 2: Identify Key Elements
In your notebook, list:
- All decision points
- All possible actions
- The logical flow between decisions and actions

### Step 3: Create the Flowchart
Draw a complete flowchart representing Maria's cake-baking decision process.

### Step 4: Test Your Flowchart
Trace through your flowchart with different scenarios:
- Maria has all cake ingredients
- Maria is missing eggs, the store is open
- Maria is missing flour, the store is closed, but she has cookie ingredients
- Maria is missing flour, the store is closed, and she doesn't have cookie ingredients

## Part 5: Flowcharting Algorithms

Now let's practice creating flowcharts for simple algorithms (step-by-step procedures).

### Algorithm 1: Finding the Largest Number
Create a flowchart for finding the largest of three numbers:
1. Input three numbers: A, B, and C
2. Compare A with B to find the larger one
3. Compare that result with C
4. Display the largest number

### Algorithm 2: Calculating Discounted Price
Create a flowchart for calculating a discounted price:
1. Input original price
2. Input discount percentage
3. If the original price is above $100, apply the discount
4. If the original price is $100 or less, apply half the discount
5. Calculate and display the final price

## Part 6: Collaborative Flowcharting (Optional Group Activity)

If you're working with others, try this collaborative exercise:

### Step 1: Select a Complex Process
Choose a complex process that everyone is familiar with, such as:
- Making a group decision about where to go for lunch
- Planning a class project or event
- Creating a study schedule for exams

### Step 2: Individual Drafts
Each person creates their own flowchart for the process.

### Step 3: Compare and Combine
Compare the different flowcharts and discuss:
- What decision points did everyone include?
- What different approaches were taken?
- What important factors did some people consider that others missed?

### Step 4: Create a Master Flowchart
Work together to create a comprehensive flowchart that incorporates the best elements from each individual chart.

## Templates for Flowchart Symbols

If you find it difficult to draw the symbols freehand, here are simplified templates you can trace or copy:

```
Start/End:
  .--------.
 /          \
(            )
 \          /
  '--------'

Process:
.-------------.
|             |
|             |
'-------------'

Decision:
     ./.\.
    /     \
   /       \
  <         >
   \       /
    \     /
     '\.'

Input/Output:
   .--------.
  /          \
 /            \
'-------------'

Connector:
   .---.
  |     |
  |  A  |
  |     |
   '---'
```

## Extension Activities

### 1. Flowchart Revision
Take one of your flowcharts and optimize it by:
- Reducing the number of decision points if possible
- Finding more efficient paths
- Adding additional factors to make it more comprehensive

### 2. Programming Concepts in Flowcharts
Research and create flowcharts that represent these programming concepts:
- A simple counting loop (1 to 10)
- An input validation process
- A simple searching algorithm

### 3. Digital Flowcharts
If you have access to a computer, try using one of these free online flowchart tools:
- draw.io
- Lucidchart (free version)
- Google Drawings

## Reflection Questions

In your notebook, answer these questions:
1. How did creating flowcharts help you understand decision processes better?
2. What was the most challenging part of creating flowcharts?
3. How might flowcharts be useful in your daily life or studies?
4. What differences did you notice between flowcharting simple vs. complex processes?
5. How do you think flowcharts help programmers plan their code?

## Connection to Programming

Flowcharts are widely used in programming to plan and document the logic of programs before writing actual code. The practice you've gained in this activity directly translates to skills that professional programmers use every day. When you eventually start coding on a computer, you'll find that creating a flowchart first makes the coding process much smoother and helps prevent logical errors.
