Rewrite each question so Logic CAN answer it with YES or NO:

**Original:** "How's the weather?"  
**For Logic:** "Is it sunny?"

**Original:** "What should I eat?"  
**For Logic:** _______________________________

**Original:** "How tired am I?"  
**For Logic:** _______________________________

**Original:** "Will I have fun?"  
**For Logic:** _______________________________

**Original:** "What time is it?"

## PART 4: Using AND, OR, NOT

Now combine questions using Logic's tools.

**Scenario: Should I go outside?**

**YES/NO questions:**
- Is it sunny? YES
- Do I have free time? YES
- Do I want to play? YES

**Using AND:**  
"Is it sunny AND do I have free time?" = YES (because both are YES)

**Using OR:**  
"Is it sunny OR is it fun outside?" = YES (because at least one is YES)

**Your turn:**

**Scenario: Should I eat lunch?**

**YES/NO questions to ask:**
1. Am I hungry? ___
2. Is there food? ___
3. Do I have time? ___

**Using AND:**  
"Am I hungry AND is there food?" = ___

**Using OR:**  
"Am I hungry OR is it lunchtime?" = ___

**Using NOT:**  
"Am I NOT hungry?" = ___ (flip your hungry answer)

## PART 5: PLAY WITH A FRIEND (Optional)

Take turns asking each other YES/NO questions.

One person picks a topic. The other person tries to "be Logic" and answer YES or NO to tricky questions.

**Example topics:**
- Going to the park
- Eating dessert
- Playing a game
- Doing homework
- Going to bed
