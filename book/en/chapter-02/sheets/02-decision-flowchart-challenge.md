# ACTIVITY SHEET: Chapter 2 / Decision Flowchart Challenge

**Concept:** Flowcharts show how Logic makes decisions step by step.

---

## MATERIALS NEEDED

☐ This sheet  
☐ A pencil or pen  
☐ Optional: Ruler for drawing straight lines  

**TIME:** 25-35 minutes

---

## WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

A flowchart is a map of Logic's thinking. In this activity, you'll trace through flowcharts and create your own.

---

## FLOWCHART SYMBOLS

Remember these shapes:

```
○ or ◇ = Start/Stop
□ = Do something (action)
◇ = Ask a question (decision - YES/NO)
→ = Arrow showing direction of flow
```

## PART 1: Follow the Flowchart

Here's a flowchart for "Should I have snack?"

```
        ┌──────────┐
        │  START   │
        └─────┬────┘
              │
        ┌─────▼──────────┐
        │ Am I hungry?   │
        └─┬─────────┬────┘
          │ YES     │ NO
          │         │
     ┌────▼──┐  ┌───▼──────┐
     │Get    │  │Do          │
     │snack  │  │homework    │
     └────┬──┘  └────┬───────┘
          │          │
          └────┬─────┘
               │
            ┌──▼──┐
            │ END │
            └─────┘
```

**Follow the flowchart:**

1. Start at START
2. Am I hungry? (Circle YES or NO based on right now)
3. Follow the arrow to what happens
4. Read what you do
5. End

**Now answer:**
- If you're hungry, what would Logic tell you to do?
  _______________________________
- If you're not hungry, what would Logic tell you to do?
  _______________________________

## PART 2: Create a Simple Flowchart

**Scenario: Should I watch a movie?**

**Logic's questions:**
1. Do I have free time?
2. Are there any chores left?
3. Do I want to relax?

**My flowchart:**

Use the space below to draw a flowchart. You can:
- Draw boxes and diamonds
- Use YES/NO labels on arrows
- Show what happens at each decision

Tip: Start with START at the top. End with END at the bottom.

```
[SPACE FOR DRAWING - about 15 lines]




```

## PART 3: Trace Your Flowchart

Now trace YOUR flowchart with different scenarios:

**Scenario A:** I have free time, no chores, want to relax
- Follow your flowchart → What does it say to do?
  _______________________________

**Scenario B:** I have free time, have chores, want to relax
- Follow your flowchart → What does it say to do?
  _______________________________

**Scenario C:** I don't have free time, no chores, want to relax
- Follow your flowchart → What does it say to do?
  _______________________________

---

## PART 4: Real-World Decision

**Pick a decision you need to make:**

_______________________________

**List the YES/NO questions Logic should ask:**

1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________

**Draw a flowchart for this decision:**

(Draw on back of sheet if needed)

```

```

## PART 5: Check Your Logic

Trace your flowchart with 3 different scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** 
- Conditions: _______________________________
- Flowchart says: _______________________________

**Scenario 2:**
- Conditions: _______________________________
- Flowchart says: _______________________________

**Scenario 3:**
- Conditions: _______________________________
- Flowchart says: _______________________________

## REFLECTION

**1. What was hardest about making a flowchart?**

_________________________________________________

**2. Did you find any mistakes in your flowchart when you tested it?**

_________________________________________________

**3. Can someone else follow your flowchart easily?**

_________________________________________________

## EXTRA CHALLENGE

Make a flowchart for something MORE complicated:
- A game with multiple rules
- A daily routine (wake up, eat, school, home, dinner, bed)
- A problem you solve often

The more complex, the more paths the flowchart needs!

## YOU DID IT! 🎉

You just created a flowchart. This is exactly how programmers plan out code before they write it.

**Return this sheet so someone else can practice.**
