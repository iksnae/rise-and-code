# ACTIVITY SHEET: Chapter 2 / Pseudocode Translator

**Concept:** Translating real-world thinking into pseudocode structure.

---

## MATERIALS NEEDED

☐ This sheet  
☐ A pencil or pen  

**TIME:** 20-30 minutes

---

## WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

Pseudocode is code-like instructions in plain English. This activity teaches you to write structured thinking.

---

## PART 1: Translate Real-World to Pseudocode

**Scenario: Making lunch**

**Real thinking (messy):**
"Well, I need to check if I'm hungry. If I'm hungry, I should see what food is available. If there's good food, I'll make a meal. But if there's no good food, I might just make a snack or wait until dinner."

**Pseudocode (structured):**
```
START
  IF (I'm hungry) THEN
    Check what food is available
    IF (good food exists) THEN
      Make a meal
    ELSE
      Make a snack
    END IF
  ELSE
    Wait until dinner
  END IF
END
```

Notice: Same thinking, but organized with IF/THEN/ELSE and clear steps.

## PART 2: Your Turn - Translate to Pseudocode

**Scenario 1: Doing homework**

**Real thinking:**
"I should do my homework after school, but I'm tired. If I'm not too tired, I'll do it right away. If I'm really tired, I'll take a break first. Either way, I need to do it before dinner."

**Pseudocode:**

```
START


END
```

**Scenario 2: Going out with friends**

**Real thinking:**
"I want to go out, but first I need to check if I have money. If I have money, I need to ask my parents. If they say yes AND the weather is good, then I'll go. Otherwise I'll stay home."

**Pseudocode:**

```
START


END
```

---

## PART 3: Write Pseudocode from Scratch

Pick a real decision YOU make regularly:

_______________________________

List the YES/NO questions you ask:

1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________

**Write pseudocode for this decision:**

```
START


END
```

---

## PART 4: Find the Mistake

Someone wrote this pseudocode for "Should I eat a snack?"

```
START
  IF (I'm hungry) THEN
    Get snack
    Eat snack
  END IF
END
```

**Problems with this pseudocode:**

1. What if there's NO snack available?
2. What if I'm NOT hungry?

**Rewrite it to fix these problems:**

```
START


END
```

## PART 5: Translate Flowchart to Pseudocode

**Flowchart: Get ready for school**

```
        ┌──────────┐
        │  START   │
        └─────┬────┘
              │
        ┌─────▼──────────┐
        │ Is it a school │
        │ day?           │
        └─┬─────────┬────┘
          │ YES     │ NO
          │         │
      ┌───▼───┐  ┌──▼────┐
      │Get    │  │Sleep  │
      │ready  │  │in     │
      └───┬───┘  └──┬────┘
          │         │
          └────┬────┘
               │
            ┌──▼──┐
            │ END │
            └─────┘
```

**Pseudocode:**

```
START


END
```

## PART 6: Check Your Pseudocode

Does YOUR pseudocode have:

☐ START and END?
☐ IF/THEN/ELSE for decisions?
☐ One step per line?
☐ Indented steps under IF/THEN/ELSE?
☐ Clear English (not actual code)?

---

## REFLECTION

**1. Is pseudocode harder than writing naturally, or easier?**

_________________________________________________

**2. Does pseudocode help you see mistakes?**

_________________________________________________

**3. Do you think someone else could follow your pseudocode?**

_________________________________________________

## EXTRA CHALLENGE

Write pseudocode for something more complicated:
- Your complete morning routine (wake up to leaving house)
- A game with multiple rules
- A complex decision with lots of nested IF/THEN/ELSE

The more complex, the more useful pseudocode becomes!

## YOU DID IT! 🎉

You just learned pseudocode. This is exactly how programmers plan real code.

**Return this sheet so someone else can practice.**
