# Activity: Data Type Safari - Finding Data in the Wild

## Overview
This activity helps you recognize and categorize different types of data that exist in your everyday environment. By becoming a "data detective," you'll develop a sharper eye for identifying the building blocks of information that programs work with.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify different types of data in everyday contexts
- Categorize information according to its data type
- Recognize how different data types serve different purposes
- Connect abstract programming concepts to concrete examples
- Develop an intuition for data classification

## Materials Needed
- Your notebook
- Pencil or pen
- Optional: colored pencils for categorization
- Optional: a newspaper, magazine, receipt, or other documents with various data

## Time Required
30-45 minutes

## Instructions

### Part 1: Data Scavenger Hunt

1. Choose three different environments or sources from the list below:
   - Your current surroundings (room, outdoors, etc.)
   - A newspaper or magazine
   - A receipt or bill
   - A food product package
   - A mobile phone (if available)
   - A textbook or notebook
   - An identification card or document
   - A poster or advertisement

2. For each environment or source, find and list at least 10 pieces of data. Try to find as many different types as possible.

3. For each piece of data, record:
   - The data item (what it is)
   - Where you found it
   - What purpose it serves

### Part 2: Data Classification

Now that you've collected various data items, it's time to classify them by data type:

1. In your notebook, create a table with these columns:
   - Data Item
   - Data Type (see categories below)
   - Purpose or Use

2. For each data item from your scavenger hunt, determine which type it best fits into:
   - **Number - Integer**: Whole numbers without decimal points (e.g., count of items, age)
   - **Number - Decimal**: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., price, measurement)
   - **Text/String**: Words, letters, or symbols (e.g., name, address)
   - **Boolean**: True/false or yes/no information (e.g., completed status)
   - **Date/Time**: Calendar dates or clock times
   - **List/Collection**: Groups of related items
   - **Other/Composite**: Complex data that combines multiple types

3. Fill in the purpose or use column with a brief description of how the data is used or what it represents.

### Part 3: Data Visualization Map

Create a visual "data map" of one of your environments:

1. Draw a simple diagram of the environment you chose (e.g., sketch your room, outline of a newspaper page, etc.)
2. Mark the locations where you found different pieces of data
3. Use a color-coding system to indicate different data types
4. Include a legend explaining your color system

### Part 4: Data Stories

Choose three items from your data collection and, for each one, write a brief "data story" that explains:

1. What the data represents
2. How it might be collected
3. How it might be processed or transformed
4. What decisions might be made using this data
5. How a program might store and manipulate this data

### Part 5: Data Type Challenges

Test your understanding with these classification challenges. For each scenario, identify the most appropriate data type(s):

1. A traffic light showing red, yellow, or green
2. The temperature forecast for the next 5 days
3. A list of ingredients in a recipe
4. Whether a student passed or failed an exam
5. The number of people in your household
6. Your full name
7. The distance between two cities
8. The days of the week
9. A phone number
10. The balance in a bank account

## Examples

Here's an example of a completed Part 2 table:

| Data Item | Data Type | Purpose/Use |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 37.5Â°C | Number - Decimal | Body temperature measurement to determine fever |
| "Sale Today Only!" | Text/String | Message to attract customer attention |
| 42 | Number - Integer | Count of items in stock |
| Monday, March 16, 2025 | Date/Time | Indicates when an event will occur |
| Out of stock: Yes | Boolean | Indicates product availability status |
| Red, Blue, Green | List/Collection | Available color options for a product |

## Reflection Questions

After completing the activity, consider these questions:

1. Which data types did you find most frequently in your environments?
2. Were there any data items that were difficult to classify? Why?
3. How would a program need to handle different types of data differently?
4. Did you notice any patterns in how different data types are presented visually?
5. Can you think of examples where converting between data types would be necessary?
6. How do the data types you identified relate to the programming concepts we've learned?

## Extension Activities

1. **Data Type Transformation**: Choose five items from your collection and describe how they might be converted to other data types. For example, how might a date be represented as a string or a number?

2. **Create a Data Dictionary**: For an environment like your bedroom or kitchen, create a comprehensive "data dictionary" that catalogs all the different pieces of information and their types.

3. **Data Type Interview**: Ask a friend or family member to identify data in their everyday life and compare their observations with yours. Do they categorize things similarly?

4. **Program Design Sketch**: Choose a simple real-world process (like checking out at a store) and sketch what data types would be needed to create a program for this process.

## Connection to Programming

The ability to recognize different types of data is fundamental to programming. When writing code, you'll constantly make decisions about:

- Which data type is most appropriate for storing particular information
- How to convert between data types when necessary
- What operations can be performed on different types of data

This activity helps build the classification skills you'll need when designing and implementing programs, regardless of the specific programming language you might use in the future.

## Key Takeaways

- Data exists all around us in various forms
- Different types of data serve different purposes and have different properties
- The choice of data type affects what operations can be performed
- Real-world information must be translated into appropriate data types for use in programs
- Recognizing data types is a key skill for effective programming
