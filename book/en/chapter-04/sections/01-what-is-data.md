# What is Data?

## Introduction

Meet **Data**—our guide who notices patterns everywhere! 📊

Every day, you see information without thinking about it: the time on a clock, a friend's name, the price at a store, the color of the sky. In programming, we call all this "data." Data is the fuel that programs run on. Understanding data is step one to understanding programming.

## What is Data?

Data is simply information written in a form computers can work with. It can be almost anything: numbers, text, images, sounds, measurements, or facts.

Think of data like art supplies: a painter uses paint, brushes, and canvas; a program uses data to create results.

### Data All Around Us

Without even noticing, you use data constantly:

- **Personal**: Your name, age, address, preferences
- **Money**: Cost of items, payments, receipts
- **Measurements**: Temperature, weight, distance, time
- **Records**: School grades, medical history, books read
- **Communication**: Messages, calls, emails, letters

Each piece serves a purpose. Your name identifies you. A price tells you if you can afford something. A temperature tells you how to dress.

## Data vs. Information

What's the difference?

- **Data** = raw facts (26°C, 28°C, 24°C, 30°C)
- **Information** = data that's been processed and made meaningful ("Average temperature this week was 27°C—3° warmer than last week")

Programs turn data into information.

## Why Data Matters

Programs do four things with data:

1. **Input**: Receive data from users, sensors, files
2. **Processing**: Calculate, transform, or manipulate data
3. **Storage**: Save data for later
4. **Output**: Show data as information humans understand

**Example—a calculator**:
- **Input**: Numbers you type (data)
- **Process**: Add/subtract/multiply (processing)
- **Output**: Result on screen (information)

Even games are data machines: player positions, scores, graphics, game state—all data running behind the scenes.

## Properties of Data

Every piece of data has qualities:

1. **Type**: Different kinds (numbers, text, etc.) behave differently
2. **Value**: The actual information (the number 42, the name "Sofia")
3. **Size**: How much space it takes up
4. **Structure**: How it's organized (one piece? a list? a table?)
5. **Format**: How it's written or displayed

## How Humans and Computers See Data

**Humans see**: Words, pictures, sounds, numbers we understand

**Computers see**: 1s and 0s (binary)

Computers are amazing at converting between formats. You see a picture on screen, but internally it's stored as 1s and 0s. You type a letter, the computer stores it as binary, then displays it for you. All seamless!

## The Data Cycle

Data travels through a journey in programs:

1. **Collect**: Gather from users, sensors, or other sources
2. **Store**: Save for later
3. **Process**: Transform to extract value
4. **Analyze**: Interpret to find insights
5. **Present**: Display for humans to see
6. **Archive or Delete**: Keep long-term or remove

Your programs might do any or all of these.

## Activity: Hunt for Data! 👀

Look around you. Find 10 pieces of data nearby. Examples:
- Numbers on a clock
- Text on a book
- Colors of objects
- Temperatures
- Names of places
- Sizes or weights

For each, ask:
- What type is it? (number, text, etc.)
- What does it do?
- How might a program use it?

**See Activity Sheet 4A** for a hunting template!

## Key Takeaways ✨

- Data is information in a form computers can work with
- You see data constantly: numbers, text, colors, measurements
- Programs collect, store, manipulate, and show data
- Different data types have different powers
- Computers see everything as 1s and 0s, but show it as words and pictures
- Understanding data is the foundation of programming
