# Glossary of Key Terms

Welcome to the programming glossary! As you continue your coding journey, you'll encounter many technical terms. This glossary provides clear, accessible definitions of key programming concepts used throughout this book—written for learners at all levels.

## Core Programming Concepts

### Algorithm
A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms form the foundation of programming. Example: Instructions for making a sandwich are an algorithm.

### Pseudocode
A way of writing algorithms using a mixture of plain language and programming-like syntax. Pseudocode helps you plan solutions before writing actual code.

### Computational Thinking
The approach of solving problems by breaking them into smaller pieces, recognizing patterns, focusing on important details, and designing step-by-step solutions. The foundation of programming.

### Debugging
The process of finding and fixing errors in your code or algorithm. An essential skill for every programmer.

## Logic and Decision-Making

### Boolean
A data type that has only two possible values: TRUE or FALSE. Used for making decisions in programs.

### Conditional Statement
A programming structure that allows different actions based on different conditions. Example: "IF the light is red, THEN stop the car."

### Logic Gate
A basic building block in digital systems that processes Boolean inputs and produces a Boolean output. Common types: AND, OR, NOT.

### Comparison Operator
Symbols used to compare two values. Common operators: = (equals), < (less than), > (greater than), ≠ (not equal).

### Truth Table
A table that shows all possible combinations of Boolean inputs and their corresponding outputs.

## Data and Variables

### Data
Information or facts represented in a form that a computer can process.

### Variable
A named container that stores a value. You can think of a variable as a labeled box that holds information.

### Data Type
The category of data that a variable can hold. Common types: numbers, text (strings), Boolean values.

### Integer
A whole number (positive, negative, or zero) without decimal places. Example: 5, -42, 0.

### Floating-Point Number (Float)
A number that includes a decimal point. Used for measurements and precise calculations. Example: 3.14, -0.5.

### String
A sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) treated as text. Strings are enclosed in quotes. Example: "Hello, World!"

### Array
A collection of multiple values stored together under one name. You can access each value by its position. Example: A list of student names.

### Index
The position of an element in an array or list. Typically counting starts at 0 or 1 depending on the system.

## Control Structures

### Loop
A structure that repeats a block of code multiple times. Loops are essential for handling repetitive tasks efficiently.

### For Loop
A loop that repeats a specific number of times, usually using a counter variable.

### While Loop
A loop that continues repeating as long as a condition is TRUE. The condition is checked before each iteration.

### Do-While Loop
Similar to a While loop, but the code block runs at least once before checking the condition.

### Iteration
One complete execution of the code inside a loop. If a loop runs 5 times, that's 5 iterations.

### Break Statement
A command that exits a loop early, before the normal end condition is reached.

### Continue Statement
A command that skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration of a loop.

## Functions and Modularity

### Function
A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help organize code and avoid repetition.

### Parameter
A variable that a function accepts as input. Functions can have zero or more parameters.

### Return Value
The output that a function produces. Not all functions return a value.

### Scope
The part of a program where a variable is accessible. Variables created inside a function typically can't be used outside it.

### Recursion
When a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller similar problems.

## Data Structures and Organization

### List
An ordered collection of elements. Similar to an array but often more flexible.

### Dictionary
A collection of key-value pairs, where you can look up values using their keys. Also called a hash table or map.

### Stack
A data structure where the last item added is the first one removed (Last In, First Out - LIFO).

### Queue
A data structure where the first item added is the first one removed (First In, First Out - FIFO).

### Graph
A structure made up of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Used to represent networks and relationships.

### Tree
A type of graph where nodes are arranged in a hierarchical structure with a root node at the top.

## Algorithm Concepts

### Sorting
Arranging elements in a specific order (usually ascending or descending). Common algorithms: bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort.

### Searching
Finding a specific element in a collection. Common algorithms: linear search, binary search.

### Big O Notation
A way to describe how the performance of an algorithm scales as the input size grows. Written as O(n), O(n²), etc.

### Time Complexity
How much time an algorithm takes to run relative to the size of its input.

### Space Complexity
How much memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input.

### Brute Force
A straightforward approach to solving a problem by trying all possible solutions. Often simple but potentially slow.

### Divide and Conquer
A strategy that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each one, then combines the solutions.

## Programming Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
A principle that encourages writing reusable code rather than copying the same code multiple times.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
A principle that favors simple, straightforward solutions over unnecessarily complex ones.

### Modularity
Organizing code into independent, reusable components (modules or functions).

### Abstraction
Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only what's necessary. Helps manage complexity.

### Encapsulation
Bundling data and functions together and hiding internal details from the outside.

## Common Programming Patterns

### Pattern
A reusable solution to a common problem in programming.

### If-Then Pattern
Using conditional statements to make decisions: IF condition THEN action.

### Loop Pattern
Repeating an action multiple times. Variations: For loops, While loops, Do-While loops.

### Accumulator Pattern
Repeatedly updating a variable to build up a final result. Example: Summing all numbers in a list.

### Counter Pattern
Using a variable to keep track of how many times something has happened.

### Search Pattern
Looking through a collection to find specific elements matching criteria.

## Documentation and Communication

### Comment
Text in code that explains what the code does. Ignored by the computer, meant for human readers.

### Documentation
Written explanation of how code works and how to use it.

### Pseudocode
Human-readable code that describes an algorithm without specific programming language syntax.

### Flowchart
A visual diagram showing the flow of logic in an algorithm or process.

### Version Control
A system for tracking changes to code over time, allowing you to revert to earlier versions if needed.

## Problem-Solving Terms

### Edge Case
An unusual or extreme input that might break typical assumptions about a problem.

### Base Case
In recursion, the condition that stops the recursive calls and returns a value.

### Constraint
A limitation or requirement that a solution must satisfy.

### Optimization
Improving code to make it faster, use less memory, or be more elegant.

### Refactoring
Rewriting code to improve its structure and clarity without changing its functionality.

## Systems and Architecture

### System
A collection of interacting components designed to accomplish a specific purpose.

### Input
Data that flows into a system.

### Output
Data that flows out of a system after being processed.

### Black Box
A component where you know what goes in and what comes out, but not how it works internally.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and tools that allows different software components to communicate.

## Emerging Concepts

### Artificial Intelligence
Computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

### Machine Learning
A type of AI where systems improve their performance through experience rather than explicit programming.

### Cryptography
The practice of protecting information through encoding and encryption.

### Cybersecurity
Protecting computer systems and data from unauthorized access and attacks.
