# Rise & Code
## A Programming Book for Everyone

### Welcome

Programming powers the world—from the apps on your phone to the videos you watch to the games you play. But here's the best part: you don't need fancy technology to learn how coders think. In this book, you'll use pen, paper, and your imagination to build the skills that real programmers use every day. Let's learn together.

Every chapter is an adventure. You'll solve puzzles, run algorithms by hand, work with data, and discover how code shapes the real world. By the end, you'll understand what programmers actually do—and you might just decide you want to be one.

### How to Use This Book

1. **Read each section** and follow along with the examples
2. **Do the activities** in your notebook or on paper—this is where the magic happens
3. **Use your coding notebook** to track your ideas, mistakes, and discoveries (every great programmer does this!)
