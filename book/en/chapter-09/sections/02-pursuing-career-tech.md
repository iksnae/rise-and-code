2. **Design solutions** to real problems in your community
3. **Create detailed pseudocode** and algorithms
4. **Develop flowcharts** for complex systems
5. **Write out project plans** that could be implemented when you gain computer access

When you do have computer access, focus on creating small, complete projects that demonstrate your capabilities rather than leaving many projects unfinished.

## Overcoming Barriers to Entry

Many aspiring technologists face barriers to entering the field. Here are strategies for addressing common challenges:

### Limited Technology Access

- **Maximize public resources**: Libraries, schools, and community centers often provide computer access.
- **Consider shared devices**: Pool resources with others to acquire shared computing equipment.
- **Use mobile devices**: Smartphones can serve as development platforms for learning programming.
- **Practice offline**: Continue developing your logical and algorithmic thinking skills even when offline.

### Geographic Limitations

- **Remote work opportunities**: Many tech roles can be performed remotely.
- **Relocation planning**: Research tech hubs or cities with growing tech sectors if moving is an option.
- **Local needs**: Identify technology needs in your own community that could become job opportunities.
- **Community building**: Start a tech community in your area to create opportunities locally.

### Financial Constraints

- **Scholarship programs**: Many organizations offer scholarships for technology education.
- **Income share agreements**: Some training programs let you pay after you secure employment.
- **Employer training**: Some companies provide training for entry-level positions.
- **Gradual investment**: Start with free resources and invest in more training as your income allows.

### Knowledge Gaps

- **Structured learning paths**: Follow curriculum outlines from established educational programs even if self-studying.
- **Mentorship**: Seek guidance from those working in your desired field.
- **Community support**: Join online or local groups for peer learning and advice.
- **Targeted practice**: Identify specific weaknesses and focus your practice time on improving those areas.

## Entry Points to Tech Careers
