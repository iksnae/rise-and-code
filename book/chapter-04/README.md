# Chapter 4: Data Explorers - Understanding Variables and Data Types

Welcome to the fourth chapter of "Rise & Code"! In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of data in programming and how we store, organize, and manipulate it through variables and data types. Understanding data is foundational to programming, as nearly every program involves working with some form of information.

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand what data is and why it's important in programming
- Learn about different data types and their characteristics
- Master the concept of variables as containers for data
- Practice manipulating and transforming data
- Recognize how data types affect operations and calculations

## Sections

1. [What is Data?](sections/01-what-is-data.md)
2. [Types of Data and Variables](sections/02-types-of-data-and-variables.md)
3. [How to Manipulate Data](sections/03-how-to-manipulate-data.md)
