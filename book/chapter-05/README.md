# Chapter 5: Control Creators - Loops and Repetition

Welcome to the fifth chapter of "Rise & Code"! In this chapter, we'll explore the power of loops and repetition in programming. Loops allow computers to perform tasks repeatedly without requiring us to write the same instructions over and over. This ability to repeat operations efficiently is what gives computers much of their problem-solving power.

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand what loops are and why they're essential in programming
- Learn different types of loops and when to use each one
- Practice tracking variable changes through loop iterations
- Develop skills for identifying tasks suitable for loops
- Apply loops to solve real-world problems efficiently

## Sections

1. [Understanding Loops](sections/01-understanding-loops.md)
2. [Crafting Repetitive Tasks](sections/02-crafting-repetitive-tasks.md)
3. [Real-world Looping Examples](sections/03-real-world-looping-examples.md)

## Activities

- [Loop Tracker: Visualizing Iterations](activities/01-loop-tracker.md)
