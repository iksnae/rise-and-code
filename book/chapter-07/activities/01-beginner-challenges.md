- Variables
- Loops

### Example
```
Input: "CODE"
Output: "EDOC"
```

### Workspace Setup
```
Word to reverse: ________

Table format:
Position | Original Letter | Reversed Position | New Letter
---------|----------------|------------------|------------
1        |                |                  |
2        |                |                  |

4        |                |                  |
```

### Hints
1. Think about how to access letters from both ends
2. Consider how to swap positions
3. Track which letters you've already moved

### Encoded Solution
```
Process: HVWWHO-WVDO-HFSODFH
(Encoding: Shift each letter back by 3)
```

## Challenge 3: Even Number Counter ⭐

### Problem Statement
Create an algorithm that counts how many even numbers are in a given list of numbers.

### Required Skills
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic

### Example
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 3 (because 2, 4, and 6 are even)
```

### Workspace Setup
```
Numbers to check: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

Table format:
Number | Is Even? | Running Count
--------|----------|---------------
        |          |
        |          |
        |          |
        |          |
        |          |
        |          |
```

### Hints
1. How can you tell if a number is even?
2. Think about keeping a running total
3. Consider what to do with each number

### Encoded Solution
```
Algorithm: FKHFNBPRG2BFRXQWBXS
(Encoding: Shift each character up by 3)
```

## Challenge 4: Temperature Converter ⭐

### Problem Statement
Create an algorithm that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

### Required Skills
- Variables
- Arithmetic operations
- Order of operations

### Example
```
Input: 0°C
Output: 32°F
```

### Workspace Setup
```
Temperature in Celsius: _____

Calculation steps:
1. _____________________
2. _____________________
3. _____________________

Final temperature in Fahrenheit: _____
```

### Hints
1. Break down the formula into steps
2. Consider the order of operations
3. Think about how to handle decimal numbers

### Encoded Solution
```
Steps: PXOWLSOB9GLYLGH5DGG32
(Encoding: Shift each character up by 3)
```

## Challenge 5: Name Formatter ⭐

### Problem Statement
Create an algorithm that takes a first name and last name and formats them into "Last, First"

### Required Skills
- String manipulation
- Variables
- Basic formatting

### Example
```
Input: First = "Ada", Last = "Lovelace"
Output: "Lovelace, Ada"
```

### Workspace Setup
```
First Name: _____________
Last Name: _____________

Steps:
1. _____________________
2. _____________________
3. _____________________

Final format: _____________
```

### Hints
