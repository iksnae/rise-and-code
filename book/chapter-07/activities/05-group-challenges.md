## Challenge 3: Debug-a-thon 游논

### Problem Statement
Work in pairs to find and fix bugs in the following programs. One person explains their thinking while the other asks questions and provides feedback.

### Program 1: Calculator
```
Step 1: Get two numbers (a, b)
Step 2: Get operation (+, -, *, /)
Step 3: If operation is +
Step 4:    Result = a + b
Step 5: If operation is -
Step 6:    Result = a - b
Step 7: If operation is *
Step 8:    Result = a * b
Step 9: If operation is /
Step 10:   Result = a / b
Step 11: Print Result
```

### Program 2: Word Counter
```
Step 1: Get text input
Step 2: Set count = 0
Step 3: For each character in text
Step 4:    If character is space
Step 5:        Add 1 to count
Step 6: Print count + 1
```

### Debugging Process
1. Partner A explains the code
2. Partner B asks questions
3. Both identify potential issues
4. Work together on fixes
5. Test the solutions

### Discussion Topics
- What bugs did you find?
- How did you find them?
- What was your fix?
- How did you verify the fix?

## Challenge 4: Feature Extension Project 游논

### Problem Statement
Work in groups to extend a basic program with new features. Each team member should contribute at least one feature while maintaining code consistency.

### Base Program: Todo List
```
Step 1: Initialize empty todo list
Step 2: Show menu (Add, List, Done, Quit)
Step 3: If Add selected
Step 4:    Get task description
Step 5:    Add to list
Step 6: If List selected
Step 7:    Show all tasks
Step 8: If Done selected
Step 9:    Remove first task
Step 10: If Quit selected
Step 11:    End program
```

### Possible Extensions
1. Priority levels
2. Due dates
3. Categories
4. Search function
5. Task editing
6. Multiple lists

### Team Workflow
1. Planning Phase
   - Discuss features
   - Assign responsibilities
   - Plan integration

2. Development Phase
   - Implement features
   - Review each other's code
   - Integrate changes
