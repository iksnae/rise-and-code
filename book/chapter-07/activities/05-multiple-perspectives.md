# Multiple Perspectives Exercises

Welcome to the multiple perspectives exercises! These activities will help you develop your ability to approach problems from different angles, enhancing your problem-solving skills. By deliberately switching between different thinking modes, you can gain insights that might remain hidden when using a single approach.

## Exercise 1: The Multiple Hats Approach üé©

### Concept
You can gain deeper insights by deliberately adopting different perspectives or "hats" during your problem-solving process.

### Problem Statement
Improve the following number sorting algorithm by examining it from multiple angles:

```
Step 1: Get list of numbers
Step 2: For each number (i) in list
Step 3:    For each number (j) after i
Step 4:        If number[i] > number[j]
Step 5:            Swap numbers
Step 6: Print sorted list
```

### Multi-Perspective Process

#### 1. The Code Reviewer Hat
With this hat, critically examine the code as if you were reviewing someone else's work:
- Is the algorithm clear and readable?
- Are there edge cases not being handled?
- Could variable names be improved?
- Document at least 3 improvement suggestions

#### 2. The Efficiency Expert Hat
Now focus exclusively on performance:
- What is the time complexity?
- Are there unnecessary operations?
- How could this be optimized?
- Document at least 2 optimization ideas

#### 3. The User Experience Hat
Consider who will use this code:
- Is the output format user-friendly?
- Should there be input validation?
- Would error messages be helpful?
- Document at least 2 user experience improvements

#### 4. The Integrator Hat
Finally, combine your insights:
- Which improvements are most important?
- Which should be implemented first?
- How do the different perspectives complement each other?
- Create a final improved version incorporating the best ideas

### Documentation Table
```
Perspective | Observations | Suggested Improvements
------------|--------------|------------------------
Reviewer    |              |
Efficiency  |              |
User Exp.   |              |
Integrated  |              |
```

## Exercise 2: Verbalization Debugging ü¶Ü

### Concept
Explaining your code aloud, even to an inanimate object, can help you spot issues by forcing you to articulate your logic clearly.

### Problem Statement
Find and fix bugs in this calculator program by talking through the code:

```
Step 1: Get two numbers (a, b)
Step 2: Get operation (+, -, *, /)
Step 3: If operation is +
Step 4:    Result = a + b
Step 5: If operation is -
Step 6:    Result = a - b
Step 7: If operation is *
Step 8:    Result = a * b
Step 9: If operation is /
Step 10:   Result = a / b
Step 11: Print Result
```

### Verbalization Process

#### 1. Setup
Find an object (anything will work - a pen, stuffed animal, coffee mug) to focus your explanation.

#### 2. Verbalization
- Explain each line of the code out loud
- Be specific about what each step does
- Work through different input scenarios
- Listen to yourself for hesitations or uncertainties

#### 3. Documentation
As you explain, write down:
- Any bugs or issues you discover
- Moments where you hesitated or were uncertain
- Questions that arose during explanation
- Insights gained through verbalization

#### 4. Code Correction
Write a corrected version based on your findings.

### Reflection Questions
1. What bugs did you find through this process?
2. Were there issues you only noticed when explaining out loud?
3. How did verbalizing help clarify your thinking?
4. Would you have caught the same issues by just reading the code?

## Exercise 3: Role-Shifting Development üé≠

### Concept
You can simulate different perspectives in the development process by deliberately shifting between different roles at different stages.

### Problem Statement
Create an algorithm for a simple text-based game where players guess a hidden pattern.

### Requirements
1. Generate a random pattern
2. Accept player guesses
3. Provide feedback on guesses
4. Track number of attempts
5. Declare when pattern is found

### Multi-Role Process

#### 1. Requirements Analyst Role (10-15 minutes)
- Define exactly what the program should do
- Create specific acceptance criteria
- Clarify any ambiguous requirements
- Document edge cases to handle

#### 2. Designer Role (15-20 minutes)
- Sketch the algorithm structure
- Define key functions and their purposes
- Create a flowchart or pseudo-code
- Plan the user interaction flow

#### 3. Developer Role (30-40 minutes)
- Write the actual algorithm
- Focus on functionality first
- Follow the design created earlier
- Document implementation decisions

#### 4. Tester Role (15-20 minutes)
- Create test cases (expected inputs/outputs)
- Test the algorithm with different scenarios
- Document any issues found
- Categorize bugs by severity

#### 5. Reviewer/Refiner Role (15-20 minutes)
- Evaluate the complete solution
- Make improvements to the code
- Address issues found during testing
- Document lessons learned

### Documentation Template
```
Role              | Key Decisions/Findings
------------------|------------------------
Requirements      |
Designer          |
Developer         |
Tester            |
Reviewer/Refiner  |
```

## Exercise 4: The Incremental Builder üèóÔ∏è

### Concept
Breaking a complex task into smaller, achievable steps makes large projects manageable. This exercise teaches you to build solutions incrementally.

### Problem Statement
Extend a basic todo list program with new features, adding one feature at a time and ensuring each works before moving to the next.

### Base Program
```
Step 1: Initialize empty todo list
Step 2: Show menu (Add, List, Done, Quit)
Step 3: If Add selected
Step 4:    Get task description
Step 5:    Add to list
Step 6: If List selected
Step 7:    Show all tasks
Step 8: If Done selected
Step 9:    Remove first task
Step 10: If Quit selected
Step 11:    End program
```

### Incremental Development Process

#### 1. Planning Phase
- Choose 3-5 features to add (e.g., task priority, due dates, categories, search)
- Rank them in order of implementation difficulty
- Create a development roadmap with checkpoints

#### 2. Feature-by-Feature Implementation
For each feature:
1. Define specific requirements
2. Design the feature addition
3. Implement the feature
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document what you learned
6. **Important**: Celebrate the completion before moving on!

#### 3. Integration Review
After all features:
- Ensure features work well together
- Look for any inconsistencies
- Test the complete program
- Document the overall process

### Progress Tracking Table
```
Feature | Requirements | Design Notes | Implementation | Testing | Lessons Learned
--------|--------------|--------------|----------------|---------|----------------
1.      |              |              |                |         |
2.      |              |              |                |         |
3.      |              |              |                |         |
```

## Exercise 5: The Optimization Cycle üîÑ

### Concept
Professional developers rarely create perfect solutions on the first attempt. Instead, they iterate through cycles of implementation and optimization. This exercise teaches you this iterative approach.

### Problem Statement
Create and then optimize an algorithm that processes data efficiently.

### Initial Requirements
```
Process a list of numbers to:
1. Find all prime numbers
2. Calculate the average
3. Identify the highest and lowest values
4. Group numbers into ranges (0-9, 10-19, etc.)
5. Count frequency of each digit
```

### Optimization Cycle Process

#### 1. Initial Implementation
- Create a working solution focusing only on correctness
- Don't worry about efficiency yet
- Ensure all requirements are met
- Document your approach

#### 2. Self-Analysis
- Run your solution with different inputs
- Measure or estimate performance
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Document at least 3 areas for improvement

#### 3. First Optimization Pass
- Refine one aspect of your solution
- Focus on the biggest bottleneck
- Document the changes made
- Test to ensure correctness is maintained

#### 4. Second Optimization Pass
- Address the next improvement area
- Make incremental changes
- Document your reasoning
- Compare with previous versions

#### 5. Final Reflection
- Compare your initial and final solutions
- Quantify improvements if possible
- Reflect on what you learned
- Consider further optimizations for the future

### Optimization Tracking
```
Version | Description | Performance Notes | Areas for Improvement
--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------
Initial |             |                   |
Pass 1  |             |                   |
Pass 2  |             |                   |
Final   |             |                   |
```

## Multiple Perspectives Guidelines

### Creating Your Ideal Thinking Environment
1. **Minimize distractions** - Create a dedicated thinking space
2. **Physical separation** - Move to different locations for different mental modes
3. **Visual aids** - Use different colored notes for different perspectives
4. **Time boundaries** - Set clear timeboxes for each role or activity

### Documentation Practices
1. Record decisions and reasoning
2. Capture questions that arise during the process
3. Note challenges and how you overcome them
4. Track insights and learning moments

### Reflection Questions
After each exercise:
1. Which perspective was most challenging to adopt?
2. What insights would you have missed with a single approach?
3. How can you apply this multi-perspective thinking to other problems?
4. What did you learn about your own problem-solving style?

## Next Steps

1. Apply these perspective-shifting techniques to your own projects
2. Experiment with different role combinations
3. Keep a journal of insights gained through multiple perspectives
4. Gradually build your ability to switch between different thinking modes

Remember: By deliberately adopting different perspectives, you can enhance your problem-solving abilities and develop more robust solutions!
