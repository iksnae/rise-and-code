# Series of Engaging Coding Challenges

Welcome to your coding practice arena! This section introduces a carefully crafted series of challenges that will help you develop and strengthen your programming skills. Each challenge is designed to be solved using only paper and pencil, focusing on logical thinking and problem-solving rather than computer syntax.

## Understanding Challenge Levels

Our challenges are organized into three difficulty levels:

### Beginner Level (⭐)
- Focus on single concepts
- Clear, step-by-step instructions
- Immediate feedback opportunities
- Examples provided for reference

### Intermediate Level (⭐⭐)
- Combine multiple concepts
- More open-ended problems
- Multiple solution paths possible
- Limited guidance provided

### Advanced Level (⭐⭐⭐)
- Complex problem integration
- Real-world scenarios
- Optimization requirements
- Minimal guidance provided

## Challenge Components

Each challenge includes:

1. **Problem Statement**
   - Clear description of the task
   - Input/output specifications
   - Constraints and limitations
